Contains user specific data, uses persistence storage, needs to be robust and easy to maintain

prod db also stores emails here so do not delete those, it took time to get email list :)



// ---------------------- flask BE streamlining -------------------------- //
critical to streamline the flask user based codebase
needs to use keys
username      changable actually, so not in DB
userid        some UUID
email         static 

so this can just use userid UUID as primary key 
it is safer approach against leaks



maybe there should be separate mongodb 
with 

email 
username 
userid 
token 


keys at every call 

security implementation is not part of this sprint


mock mongo container with persistent data:
docker run -it   -v ~/user_db:/data/db -p 27017:27017 --rm  --name mongodb_flask   mongo
docker start mongodb_flask
docker stop  mongodb_flask



--- server.py parts ---


unificated approach: we dump all data to db, user will not be parent element, it will just be regular key in db 
it is still easy to search like this and it will make searches consistent\

we have many DBs, there should be python class module for each, so we just import the classes
it will be very easy to maintain
