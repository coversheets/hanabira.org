# Grammar Point: ～かける (〜kakeru)
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point ～かける (〜kakeru) is used in Japanese to express something that is in the process of being done or has just started to be done. It can indicate a state of something that is halfway completed or not yet finished. This expression can be attached to verbs to describe various actions or states.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: The usage of ～かける can convey that an action is partially completed or just begun. It can also express potentiality or being about to do something.
- **Structure**: The structure consists of taking a verb in its stem form (the verb minus the ます (masu) ending) and adding かける (kakeru).
- **Formation**:
    - For example, the verb "食べる" (taberu - to eat) becomes "食べかける" (tabekakeru - to be in the middle of eating).
    
    | Verb Stem        | Verb in ます-form | かける Form         |
    |------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
    | 食べる (taberu)  | 食べます (tabemasu)| 食べかける (tabekakeru) |
    | 読む (yomu)      | 読みます (yomimasu)| 読みかける (yomikakeru)   |
    | 書く (kaku)      | 書きます (kakimasu)| 書きかける (kakikakeru)   |
### Visual Aids
```plaintext
Verb Stem + かける (〜kakeru)
------------------------
食べ (tabe) + かける → 食べかける (tabekakeru)
読 (yo) + かける → 読みかける (yomikakeru)
書 (ka) + かける → 書きかける (kakikakeru)
```
## 3. Comparative Analysis
Similar expressions include:
- **～始める (〜hajimeru)**: This indicates the action has just started (e.g., "食べ始める" - to start eating). In contrast, ～かける suggests an action in progress rather than a starting point.
  
- **～終わる (〜owaru)**: While this indicates that an action has been completed, ～かける indicates that it is still ongoing.

## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Japanese culture, indicating that something is not yet completed can often convey politeness and humility. The use of such expressions indicates an awareness of the ongoing process rather than a definitive outcome.
### Levels of Politeness
Using the proper form of the verb when expressing actions (the ます form) reflects respect toward the listener. In informal contexts, casual forms are perfectly acceptable.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **話しかける** (hanasikakeru - to start talking): This expression means to begin a conversation but can imply that the conversation is ongoing.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Using かける with Completed Actions**: One common error is to use ～かける with verbs that denote completed actions.
    - Correct: 読みかけ (yomikake - halfway through reading)
    - Incorrect: 読みかけた (yomikaketa - read completely)
### Learning Strategies
- Remember that ～かける indicates a state of incompletion. Visualize actions as "half-done" to grasp its meaning easily.
