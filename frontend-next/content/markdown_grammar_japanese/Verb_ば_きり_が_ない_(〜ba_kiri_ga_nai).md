- **Verb (in the ば-form) + 切り (きり) + がない**
### Formation Diagram
The formation can be broken down as follows:
| Components      | Explanation                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Verb (ば-form)  | The conditional form of the verb (to express "if") |
| 切り (きり)      | Means "cut" or "limit," signifying a boundary      |
| がない          | Means "does not exist," indicating an absence of limits |
### Meaning and Structure

- **Verb すぎる (〜sugiru)**: Indicates an excess of something but focuses more on the negative consequences of that excess.
- **Verb ばかり (〜bakari)**: Suggests "only" or "just," but does not convey the sense of endlessness.
