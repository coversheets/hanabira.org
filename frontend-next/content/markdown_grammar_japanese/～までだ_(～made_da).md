### Levels of Politeness

  - Example: そうですまでです (sō desu made desu) - "It goes up to that point."
### Idiomatic Expressions
- それまでだ (sore made da) can mean "It’s as far as that" in discourse, often used to express resignation or giving up.

- Using the wrong form (i.e., positive instead of negative) can lead to inaccurate communication.
### Learning Strategies
