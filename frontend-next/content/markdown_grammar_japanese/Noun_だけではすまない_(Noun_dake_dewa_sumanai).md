# Noun だけではすまない (Noun dake dewa sumanai)
## Introduction
The phrase "だけではすまない" (dake dewa sumanai) is commonly used in Japanese to express that something is insufficient, inadequate, or cannot be settled by just one thing or action. This construction emphasizes that more is required or that consequences follow beyond the initial expectation.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: “Not just (something)”. It conveys that a certain action, item, or state cannot simply be resolved with just one aspect—it suggests a need for more effort, action, or acknowledgment of consequences.
  
- **Structure**:
  - The standard format of this grammar point is:
  
    ```
    Noun + だけではすまない
    ```
  Here, だけ (dake) means “only”, and すまない (sumanai) is a negative form of the verb すまる (sumaru), which means “to suffice” or “to be settled.” Hence, すまない indicates that something does not suffice.

## Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar
- **だけではない (dake dewa nai)**: This phrase also indicates that something is not just what it appears to be. However, it lacks the implication of consequences or the necessity for further action that "すまない" brings. 
  - Example:
    - 彼はただの学生だけではない。
    - (Kare wa tada no gakusei dake dewa nai.)
    - "He is not just a student."
- **だけあって (dake atte)**: This indicates a reason or a cause, meaning "as expected" or "given that". It does not carry the implication of insufficiency.
  - Example:
    - 彼女はプロだけあって、技術が素晴らしい。
    - (Kanojo wa puro dake atte, gijutsu ga subarashii.)
    - "As expected of a professional, her skills are wonderful."

## Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Japanese culture, the concept of responsibility and reciprocal actions is significant. Language reflects this when indicating that mere gestures (like apologies or kind words) may not be enough; actions must follow to rectify situations.
### Levels of Politeness
The structure can be used in both formal and informal settings, but it's essential to consider the speakers' relationships and the context when choosing how to express inadequacy or responsibility.
### Idiomatic Expressions
An expression that uses a similar context might be:
- 行動しないと言葉は意味がない。
- (Koudou shinai to kotoba wa imi ga nai.)
- "Without actions, words have no meaning."
## Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Using it with verbs directly**: Remember that this construction should follow nouns. A mistake could be incorrectly attempting to attach it to a verb.
  
- **Overuse in simple contexts**: While it can be impactful, using "だけではすまない" too frequently can come off as dramatic in casual conversations.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Remember that "だけ" is about limits and "すまない" implies consequences—think of "not just limits without consequences" to consolidate the meaning.
## Summary and Review
### Key Takeaways
- "だけではすまない" expresses that something is insufficient, emphasizing the need for additional action or recognition of consequences.
- It's crucial in both formal and informal contexts, reflecting Japanese values of responsibility.
