## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Similar Grammar Points**: 
   - **～と言う (〜to iu)**: This also conveys reported speech but is generally used when quoting someone directly.
     - Example: 彼は来ないと言っている。
     - (Kare wa konai to itte iru.)
     - "He says he won't come."
   - **～らしい (〜rashii)**: This implies that something is apparently true based on what one has heard, but with less certainty than "とのことだ".
     - Example: 彼は来ないらしい。
     - (Kare wa konai rashii.)
     - "It seems that he won't come."
### Key Differences:
- "とのことだ" is more formal and holds a stronger sense of reporting due to its structure.
- "と言う" may indicate a direct quote.
- "らしい" conveys hearsay with an implication of uncertainty.
