### Visual Aid
| Verb (ます-form) | Processor          | Final Construction        |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| 食べます           | ように             | 食べますように            |
| 行きます           | ように             | 行きますように            |
| 頑張ります         | ように             | 頑張りますように          |
For negative forms, we often use "ない" to indicate the opposite, e.g., "食べない" becomes "食べないように".
## Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points:
- **～といい (to ii)**: This also expresses wishes but is more casual and simply states "it would be good if…". In contrast, ～ますように holds a slightly more formal tone and can express deeper hopes or prayers.
- **～てほしい (te hoshii)**: This grammar point expresses desires related to what we want others to do. Unlike ～ますように, which expresses personal hopes, ～てほしい also implies direct desire towards someone's actions.
