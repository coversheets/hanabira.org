# Japanese Grammar Point: な-adjective に する/なる
## 1. Introduction
In Japanese, there are various ways to express change or transformation, particularly with na-adjectives. This lesson will focus on the usage of な-adjective followed by にする and なる, which means "to make (something) [adjective]" and "to become [adjective]" respectively.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
**な-adjective**: These are adjectives that require な (na) to connect to nouns. Example: きれい (kirei - beautiful), 便利 (benri - convenient).
**Structure and Formation**:
- **Verb Form**: 
  - **にする** (ni suru) is used to indicate making an active change to something.
  - **なる** (naru) indicates passive change, where something naturally becomes a certain state.
### Visual Aids
Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate the structure:
| Verb              | Meaning                 | Usage                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| な-adjective + にする | to make (something) [adjective] | Indicates action taken by someone      |
| な-adjective + なる   | to become [adjective]    | Indicates a natural or passive change  |
## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Other Forms
- **Verb + する**: This can also transform nouns into action (e.g., 勉強する - benkyou suru - to study).
- **Verb + になる**: A more common expression of becoming; however, it is often used with nouns rather than adjectives.
