## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar Points
- **〜とは限らない (〜to wa kagiranai)**: This phrase means "not necessarily" and suggests a possibility but does not emphasize the extremity of the situation like どころか.
- **〜ばかりか (〜bakari ka)**: This is similar and can also indicate an additional contrast. However, ばかりか tends to imply that one thing is a supplement to another, whereas どころか emphasizes a stronger contradiction.
**Examples**:

- 彼は学生ばかりか、先生でもある。 (He is not only a student; he is also a teacher.)
- 彼は勉強しないどころか、遊んでばかりいる。 (He does not just not study; he only plays around.)
