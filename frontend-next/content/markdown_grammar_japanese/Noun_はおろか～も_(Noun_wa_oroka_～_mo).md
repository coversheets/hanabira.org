# Noun はおろか～も (Noun wa oroka ～ mo)
## Introduction
The grammar point **Noun はおろか～も** is a useful expression in Japanese that denotes the idea of "not to mention" or "let alone." It emphasizes that the first noun cannot be compared to the second noun, often highlighting the extreme nature of the situation being discussed.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Structure**: 
  - Noun + はおろか + (more specific example) + も
- **Meaning**: This construction emphasizes that the first noun (the more general or broader category) is so far removed from the second noun (the more specific or extreme instance) that you can't even consider the second when talking about the first.

## Comparative Analysis
This structure is similar to **はもちろん (wa mochiron)**, which also means "of course." However, **はおろか** is used to convey a stronger sense of contrast or degree, implying that not only is the first noun inadequate, it’s almost laughable to mention the second as it’s so much more extreme.
### Example Comparison:
- Noun1 はもちろん Noun2 (Noun1 definitely includes Noun2)
- Noun1 はおろか Noun2 (Noun1 is so insufficient that discussing Noun2 is pointless)
