## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
- Using "Nounで～" is common in everyday conversation and is crucial for explaining how tasks are performed. It reflects the Japanese emphasis on method and process in both social and professional contexts.
### Levels of Politeness
- While the use of で itself is neutral, the level of politeness can be adjusted by changing the verb form. For example, using the polite form of a verb (ます form) will make the entire sentence more formal.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- 友達（ともだち）であることは幸（しあわ）せです。

### Learning Strategies
