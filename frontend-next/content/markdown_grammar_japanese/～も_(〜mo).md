When using ～も (〜mo), the level of politeness is influenced by surrounding verb conjugations. This means using casual forms in a friendly setting or polite forms in professional contexts.
## Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Incorrect Use with Particles**: Learners might mistakenly use other particles instead of ～も (〜mo) for addition.
   - Wrong: **私と行きます。** 
   - Correct: **私も行きます。**
  
2. **Negation Confusion**: Confusing the negative sentence structure with affirmative sentences can lead to misunderstandings:
   - **私も食べません。** (I also don’t eat) is different from **私も食べます。** (I also eat).
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Think of "momo" (もも) meaning peach in Japanese to remember that "also" frequently adds sweetness like a peach to a conversation.
