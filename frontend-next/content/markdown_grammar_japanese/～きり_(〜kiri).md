## Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar Points
- **だけ (dake)**: Also means "only," but is generally more versatile and can be used in a wider range of contexts.
  - Example: 友達だけ招待しました。 (I invited only friends.)
  
- **しか (shika)**: Often pairs with negative verbs to mean "only" in a restrictive sense.
  - Example: 友達しか招待しなかった。(I didn’t invite anyone except friends.)
### Nuances
- While きり emphasizes exclusivity much like だけ, it often carries a heavier undertone, suggesting a sense of finality or completeness not present in だけ.
## Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples
1. **Formal**: 
   - 彼女は一度きり会ったことがあります。
   - (I have met her only once.)
   
2. **Informal**:
   - 昨日きり、彼と会ってない。
   - (I haven’t seen him since yesterday.)
3. **Written**:

## Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
Using ～きり can convey a strong feeling of limitation which is culturally significant in Japan, where maintaining harmony and modesty is essential. The exclusive tone of きり might express humility or an acknowledgement of one’s limitations.
### Levels of Politeness
The politeness level largely depends on the context and form of speech rather than the きり itself, which can fit both formal and informal settings based on the verbs or nouns used.
### Idiomatic Expressions
A common expression using this grammar point:
- *この旅行は彼きりの経験だ。*
  - (This trip is an experience unique to him.)

2. **Confusing with だけ**: Some learners may use きり in contexts better suited for だけ, especially in non-restrictive scenarios.
### Learning Strategies
