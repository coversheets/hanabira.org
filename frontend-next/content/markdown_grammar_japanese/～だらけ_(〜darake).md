## 3. Comparative Analysis
The structure 〜だらけ can be compared to two other expressions that convey similar meanings:
- **〜まみれ (〜mamire)**: This also implies being covered in something. However, まみれ is more neutral or can even be used positively in some contexts (e.g., "汗まみれ" - "covered in sweat").
  
- **〜まん (〜man)**: This indicates that something is overflowing with a specific attribute or quality but is usually more general and less emotionally charged than だらけ.

| まみれ     | Neutral, can be positive     | Context-dependent       |
