## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Verb ては vs Verb ても (te mo)**: 
  - **ては** implies a condition and often a negative consequence, while **ても** suggests that the action occurs regardless of the condition. 
    - Example: 
      - Verb ては: 食べてはダメ (Tabete wa dame) - "You must not eat."
      - Verb ても: 食べてもいい (Tabete mo ii) - "It's okay to eat."
- **Verb ては vs Verb たら (tara)**: 
  - **ては** stresses contrast or reiteration of an action leading to a state, while **たら** suggests a more straightforward condition.
    - Example: 
      - Verb ては: 行っては帰ってくる (Itte wa kaette kuru) - "I go and return."
      - Verb たら: 行ったら帰る (Ittara kaeru) - "If I go, I'll return."
