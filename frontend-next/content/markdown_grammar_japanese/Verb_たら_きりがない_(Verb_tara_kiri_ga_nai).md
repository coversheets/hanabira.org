# Verb たら きりがない (Verb tara kiri ga nai)
## 1. Introduction
The Japanese grammar point "たらきりがない" is used to express the idea that if one continues to list things (actions, items, reasons, etc.), there would be no end to it. This phrase conveys a sense of futility or exhaustion in trying to enumerate or detail something because it is limitless or too extensive.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The phrase "たらきりがない" roughly translates to "there's no end to (verb-ing)" or "if (one) were to (do something), it would be endless." 
### Structure
- **たら** (tara): This is the conditional form of verbs. When you use a verb in the た form followed by ら, it denotes a conditional situation (if something happens).
- **きりがない** (kiri ga nai): This means "there is no end" or "there is no limit."
### Formation
To use this grammar point, follow these steps:
1. Conjugate your verb into the past tense (た form).
2. Attach ら to the end of the verb.
3. Add きりがない.
### Visual Aid

### Idiomatic Expressions
