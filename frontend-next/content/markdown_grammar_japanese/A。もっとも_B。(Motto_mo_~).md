## Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
1. **しかし (shikashi)**: Means "however", but is used at the beginning of a sentence or clause. "もっとも" is more specific in adding a nuance to the initial statement.
   - Example: 明日は休みです。しかし、宿題があります。(Ashita wa yasumi desu. Shikashi, shukudai ga arimasu.) - Tomorrow is a holiday. However, I have homework.
2. **けれども (keredomo)**: Translates to "but" and can be used interchangeably with "もっとも" to show contrast, but "もっとも" implies a more delicate nuance starting from the truth of A to B.
   - Example: この仕事は楽しいけれども、給料が低い。(Kono shigoto wa tanoshii keredomo, kyūryō ga hikui.) - This job is fun, but the salary is low.
