## Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **より (yori)**: Also used for comparisons ("than"), but does not express degree.
  - Example: 日本よりアメリカの方が大きいです。 (Nihon yori Amerika no hō ga ōkī desu.) - "America is bigger than Japan."
  
- **くらい/ぐらい (kurai/gurai)**: Indicates degree, similar to ほど but with a more casual tone.
  - Example: 食べるくらいお腹がすいている。 (Taberu kurai onaka ga suite iru.) - "I’m hungry to the extent that I could eat."
### Differences
- **～ほど～** emphasizes the relationship of degree or extent between two things, while **より** simply makes a static comparison.
- **くらい/ぐらい** is more common in spoken language and less formal than **～ほど～**.
## Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples
1. **Comparison**: 
   - 彼ほど優れた選手はいない。
