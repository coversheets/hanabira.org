- **〜しか (〜shika)**: 
  - This means "only" when used with a negative verb, emphasizing limitation.
  - Example: 私は日本語しか話せません。 (I can only speak Japanese.)
### Differences:
- **～ばかり** implies not just limitation, but also that the action is excessive or repetitive, while 〜だけ is purely restrictive and 〜しか carries a negative nuance.
