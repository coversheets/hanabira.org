### Detailed Explanation

**Structure**: 
- The structure involves taking the verb in its *te-form* and adding もらいたい (moraitai).
- The verb must be in the *te-form* to join with もらいたい.
### Structure Breakdown
1. **Te-form of the Verb**:

   - Example:
     - 食べる (taberu – to eat) → 食べて (tabete)
     - 行く (iku – to go) → 行って (itte)
     - する (suru – to do) → して (shite)
2. **Adding もらいたい (moraitai)**: 
   - もらう (morau) means "to receive." 
   - Adding たい (tai) indicates a desire for it.
   - Thus, もらいたい (moraitai) means "to want to receive."
