# Nounを余儀なくされる (Noun wo yogi naku sareru)
## 1. Introduction
In this lesson, we will explore the Japanese grammar point **Nounを余儀なくされる** (Noun wo yogi naku sareru), which translates roughly to "to be forced to do Noun" or "to be compelled to do Noun." This structure expresses an unavoidable situation or an obligation that arises, often due to external circumstances.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
**余儀なくされる** (*yogi naku sareru*) is composed of:
- **余儀** (yogi): Meaning "alternative" or "option."
- **なく** (naku): A negative form, meaning "without" or "not having."
- **される** (sareru): The passive form of the verb *suru*, meaning "to do."
Combining these, **余儀なくされる** signifies that someone is in a situation where they have no choice or other options, thereby being forced to do something.
### Structure
The structure follows this pattern:
- [Noun] + を + 余儀なくされる
**Example Breakdown:**
- 仕事 (shigoto) = "work"
- 仕事を余儀なくされる = "to be forced to do work"
### Visual Aid
| Japanese         | English                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Nounを                | [Noun] + wo                    |
| 余儀なくされる      | to be forced to do [Noun]     |
## 3. Comparative Analysis
This construction is similar to **Nounにさせられる** (Noun ni saserareru), which means "to be made to do Noun." However, the nuance of **余儀なくされる** emphasizes the lack of choice or alternatives, while **にさせられる** might simply indicate external pressure without the depth of being forced due to no options.
### Key Differences:
