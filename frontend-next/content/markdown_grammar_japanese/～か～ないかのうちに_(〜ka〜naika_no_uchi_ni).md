## Introduction
The construction ～か～ないかのうちに is used to express a situation where two events happen in quick succession, suggesting that one action occurs just before or just after another action. It can be translated to "just as; no sooner than" in English.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
1. **Meaning**: This grammar point indicates that one action occurs almost immediately after or simultaneously with another action, highlighting their close temporal relationship.
2. **Structure**:
   - The structure is formed as follows:

### Visual Aids

## Comparative Analysis
- **Similar Grammar Points**:
  - ～たら (tara): This implies a conditional ("if/when") but does not strongly indicate the immediacy between actions.
  - ～と (to): Similar to ～たら, but can also indicate general actions or predictable results rather than just immediate succession.
### Differences:
- The key difference is that ～か～ないかのうちに focuses on the immediacy of the interactions, while the other constructions do not necessarily imply a close timing.
