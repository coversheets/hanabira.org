# なにも～ません (nanimo~masen)
## 1. Introduction
The phrase なにも～ません (nanimo~masen) is a negative form used in Japanese to express "not anything" or "nothing." It is commonly used to indicate the absence of something, whether it is physical items, feelings, or any content that can be quantified.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of なにも～ません is straightforward:
- **なにも (nanimo)**: means "nothing" or "no". It reinforces the negation.
- **～ません (masen)**: is the polite negative form of the verb (the suffix from verbs indicating negation).
### Structure
1. First, identify a verb that describes an action or state.
2. Remove the suffix (for example, -ます) from the verb.
3. Add ません (masen) to create the negative form.
4. Precede the verb with なにも (nanimo).
**Formation Diagram:**
```
[なにも (nanimo)] + [Verb (masu-form)] + [ません (masen)]
```
### Examples:
- **食べる (taberu)** → 食べません (tabemasen) → なにも食べません (nanimo tabemasen) → "I don't eat anything."
- **見える (mieru)** → 見えません (mienasen) → なにも見えません (nanimo miemasen) → "I can't see anything."
## 3. Comparative Analysis
The phrase なにも～ません is similar to:
- 何も (nani mo): It also means "nothing," but using it alone can sound rough in certain contexts.
- 全く (mattaku): Means "completely" and can be used to emphasize negativity, but is less common for everyday conversations.
**Examples of Differences**:
- **なにも分かりません (nanimo wakarimasen)**: "I don't understand anything."
- **何も分からない (nani mo wakaranai)**: Informal version of the above.
- **全く分からない (mattaku wakaranai)**: "I completely don't understand," implies a stronger emphasis.
