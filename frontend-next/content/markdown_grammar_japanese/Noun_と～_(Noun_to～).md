In Japanese, the particle と (to) is used to indicate “and” or “with,” often connecting nouns or expressing companionship or association. This grammar point is essential for students to learn how to combine nouns and describe relationships in both spoken and written forms.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The particle と serves two primary functions:
- **Connecting Nouns**: When connecting two or more nouns, と acts like the English word "and."
- **Indicating Companionship or Togetherness**: It can also indicate that an action is performed together with someone or something.
### Meaning and Structure

  - For example, "りんごとバナナ" (ringo to banana) means "apples and bananas."
