## Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
Understanding direct objects is crucial in Japanese communication as it helps in expressing thoughts clearly. Japanese often emphasizes politeness, so the usage of formal structures alongside the correct particle is important in social interactions.
### Levels of Politeness
Using は (wa) instead of を can change the nuance of a sentence. While を emphasizes the direct object, は can make it seem like you are making a general statement about the subject.
