## Core Grammar Explanation

The structure "Noun1 と Noun2 を兼ねて" can be broken down as follows:

| と       | and / with                     |
| Noun2    | Function 2                     |

## Comparative Analysis
This construction is similar to other forms that express dual functions, such as:
- **Noun として (Noun to shite)**: Indicates acting as or in the capacity of a noun but does not necessarily imply a combination of functions.
- **Noun としても (Noun to shitemo)**: Often used in hypothetical statements like "even if/though it is Noun," which also does not indicate a blending of roles.
While "Noun と Noun を兼ねて" emphasizes dual attributes, "Noun として" and "Noun としても" focus more on one aspect at a time.
