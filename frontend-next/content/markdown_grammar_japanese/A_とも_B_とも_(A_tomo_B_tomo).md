## Comparative Analysis
**とも** vs **や**:
- While **とも** emphasizes equality or similarity, **や** is used to list items without the same level of equivalence.
  - **Example**: 
    - A とも B とも (Both A and B are true.)
    - A や B (A, B, etc. – not necessarily implying equivalence.)
**とも** vs **も**:
- **も** is generally used to express "too" or "also" but typically focuses on one element rather than drawing a parallel between two.
  - **Example**: 
    - 彼も行きます (He is going too.)
    - However, A とも B とも sanctions a stronger sense of togetherness in comparison.
