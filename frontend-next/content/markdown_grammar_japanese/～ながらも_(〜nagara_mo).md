# Grammar Point: ～ながらも (〜nagara mo)
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point ～ながらも (〜nagara mo) is used to express a contrast between two states or actions, often indicating that despite one thing, another is true or happening. It translates to "even though," "although," or "despite" in English.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning:** The phrase implies that an action or state exists along with another condition that may seem contradictory.
- **Structure:** 
  - The construction is formed by attaching **ながら** (nagara) to the stem form of a verb, followed by **も** (mo).
  - Format: **[Verb Stem] + ながらも**
  
### Formation Diagram

[Verb Stem] + ながらも → (Even though/Despite...)
```
Example:

## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **～ながら (〜nagara):** This form indicates simultaneous actions (doing one thing while doing another) without the contrast aspect. 
- **～のに (〜noni):** Another contrastive expression that can also mean "even though," but typically emphasizes the expectation of the opposite, making it more direct in stating disappointment or contradiction.
