# Verb させる (Verb-saseru)
## Introduction
The Japanese grammar point させる (saseru) is a causative form of verbs that indicates enabling or allowing someone to do something. This structure is crucial for expressing who causes or permits an action.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
1. **Meaning**: The causative form implies that a subject causes or allows an action to happen. It translates to "to make someone do something" or "to let someone do something."
2. **Structure**: To form the causative verb, you modify the verb stem:
   - For **ru-verbs**: Replace the る (ru) with させる (saseru).
     - Example: 食べる (taberu, to eat) → 食べさせる (tabesaseru, to make someone eat).
   - For **u-verbs**: Change the final u sound to an a sound and add せる (seru).
     - Example: 飲む (nomu, to drink) → 飲ませる (nomaseru, to make someone drink).
3. **Formation Diagram**:
   | Verb Type   | Example Base Verb | Causative Form               |
   |-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
   | Ru-verb     | 食べる (taberu)   | 食べさせる (tabesaseru)     |
   | U-verb      | 飲む (nomu)       | 飲ませる (nomaseru)         |
   | Irregular   | する (suru)       | させる (saseru)             |
   | Irregular   | 来る (kuru)       | 来させる (kosaseru)         |
## Comparative Analysis
- **Causative vs. Passive**: The causative form is often confused with the passive form (e.g., 食べられる/taberu becomes “to be eaten”). Causative focuses on the subject causing the action, while passive emphasizes receiving the action.
  
- **Causative vs. Causative Passive**: The causative can be combined with the passive form, creating a structure that emphasizes both causing and being affected. For example, 食べさせられる (tabesaseru) means "to be made to eat."
