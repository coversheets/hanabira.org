## 1. Introduction
The grammar point "ようにもれない" (you ni mo renai) expresses the idea that something is difficult or impossible to do, despite wanting to or trying to do it. This construction conveys a sense of frustration or limitation when it comes to action.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: The phrase indicates inability to perform an action despite one's intention or effort to do so.
- **Structure**:

  - The volitional form is used to indicate intention or a desire to do something, while the negative potential form expresses inability.
### Formation Diagram
```markdown
[Volitional Form] ように + [Negative Potential Form] も Verbれない
     (Wanting to...)    (But cannot...)
```
### Breakdown:
- **Volitional form**: Indicates desire (e.g., 食べよう "I'm going to eat")
- **Negative potential form**: Indicates inability (e.g., 食べられない "cannot eat")
## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **Verb ようとする (〜you to suru)**: Meaning "to attempt to do something". It focuses more on the effort or attempt rather than inability.
  - **Example**: 彼は食べようとしたが、病気で食べられなかった。 (He tried to eat, but he couldn't because he was sick.)
The key difference is that "ようにも〜れない" emphasizes the impossibility despite intent, whereas "ようとする" simply shows the intent to perform the action.
