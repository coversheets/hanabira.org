- **～の (〜no)**: Similar to こと, it can also nominalize verbs but is usually used for explaining or making inquiries about a situation.
  - Example: 行くのは好きです (iku no wa suki desu) - I like going.
### Key Differences:
- **Formality**: こと is more formal and used in written Japanese, while もの is more conversational.
