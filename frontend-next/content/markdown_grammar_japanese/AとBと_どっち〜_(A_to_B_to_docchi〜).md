The phrase "AとBとどっち〜" is commonly used in Japanese to pose questions of comparison and choice between two items, actions, or concepts. It translates to "which is A or B?" in English.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Structure**: 
  - The basic structure is:
    ```
    A と B と どっち (どちら) + [verb/adjective]
    ```
  - Here, "A" and "B" represent the two entities being compared, while "どっち" (informal) or "どちら" (formal) is used to ask "which."

### Formation Diagram
```
[Entity A] と [Entity B] と どっち / どちら
```
## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Versus "どれ"**: "どれ" is used for three or more options. For example, if you have options A, B, C, you would ask: 
  ```
  AとBとCの中でどれが好きですか？
  ```
  (Which do you like among A, B, and C?)
  
- **Usage of か**: If selecting between two options formally with "か," you would say:
  ```
  AかBか
  ```
  This is less direct and can imply some uncertainty.
