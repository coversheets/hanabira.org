# Verb て ある (Verb-te aru)
## Introduction
The grammar point **Verb て ある (Verb-te aru)** is an essential structure in Japanese that indicates a state resulting from an action. It is primarily used to talk about ongoing situations or conditions that exist because of a certain action that has been performed. 
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
**Verb-te aru** expresses that something has been done and its result still holds true. It essentially combines:
- **Verb-te form**: The て form of a verb makes it possible to connect clauses and express the completion of actions.
- **ある (aru)**: This verb signifies existence, usually for inanimate objects.
### Structure
The structure is fairly simple:
```
[Verb て-form] + ある
```
**Example:**
- 書く (kaku - to write) → 書いて (kaite - writing)  
- Combine: 書いてある (kaite aru - has been written)

Using **Verb て ある** conveys a level of awareness of one’s environment in Japanese culture. When someone refers to something being done, it implies they recognize the state of things, which is related to the Japanese value of social harmony and attention to detail.
### Idiomatic Expressions
While specific idioms using **Verb て ある** are rare, the expression **整っている** (totanotte iru - is organized) often encapsulates the state of things being well prepared or arranged.
## Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Omitting ある**: New learners may mistakenly use only the te-form, which does not convey the resultant state.

### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Remember that て ある indicates “has been done and remains so,” while ている emphasizes “is currently happening.”
- **Visual Aids**: Create flashcards that show the te-form on one side and its meaning in context on the other.
