The grammar point ～ずに (〜zu ni) is used in Japanese to express an action that is not done before another action takes place. It translates to "without doing" or "instead of doing" in English.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The construction ～ずに is formed from the negative form of a verb. Here's how it breaks down:
1. **Take the negative form** of the verb (the verb ending changes depending on the verb group).
2. **Remove the ない (nai)** ending and replace it with ず.
3. **Add に (ni)** after ず.
### Structure Example:
- **Group 1 Verb (u-verbs)**: 
  - 飲む (nomu - to drink) → 飲まない (nomanai) → 飲まず (nomazu)
- **Group 2 Verb (ru-verbs)**: 
  - 食べる (taberu - to eat) → 食べない (tabenai) → 食べず (tabezu)
- **Irregular Verb**:
  - する (suru - to do) → しない (shinai) → せず (sezu)
  - 来る (kuru - to come) → 来ない (konai) → 来ず (kozu)

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with 〜ないで (〜naide)
While both ずに and ないで express the idea of “not doing something,” there are differences:
- **ずに** is more literary and formal.
- **ないで** is more commonly used in everyday conversation and can be perceived as slightly softer in tone.
**Example Comparison**:
- 彼は食べずに外に出た。 (Kare wa tabezu ni soto ni deta.)  
  "He went outside without eating."
  
- 彼は食べないで外に出た。 (Kare wa tabenaide soto ni deta.)  
  "He went outside without eating."
  
Both sentences convey the same meaning, but the first uses the more formal ずに.
