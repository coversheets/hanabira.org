---
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of させられる combines two elements:
1. **Causative form**: This indicates that someone causes another person to do something.
2. **Passive form**: This indicates that the subject of the sentence experiences an action done to them.
### Meaning, Structure, Formation Diagram
- **Structure**: 
  - Base Verb + せる (seru, causative form) + れる (reru, passive form)
### Formation
1. Take the verb in its dictionary form.
2. Convert it to the causative form by adding せる (seru) or the appropriate causative suffix:
   - For example:
     - 食べる (taberu) → 食べさせる (tabesaseru) [to make someone eat]
     - 行く (iku) → 行かせる (ikaseru) [to make someone go]
3. Finally, add れる (reru) to form the passive:
   - 食べさせられる (tabesaserareru) [to be made to eat]
   - 行かせられる (ikasaserareru) [to be made to go]
### Visual Aid

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points:
- **Verb せる (seru)**: This form only indicates causation (making someone do something) without the passive nuance.
  - Example: 彼に行かせる (kare ni ikaseru) - "I let him go."
- **Verb れる (reru)**: This form indicates passive voice only (something is done to the subject).
  - Example: 彼は食べられた (kare wa taberareta) - "He was eaten."
### Highlighted Differences:
- させられる (saserareru) combines both the passive and causative elements, indicating the subject's lack of agency.
