## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
1. **～てから (〜te kara)**: This also indicates a sequence of actions but does not inherently carry the meaning of the first action being necessary for the second. 
   - Example: 食べてから行く (tabete kara iku) - "I'll go after eating."
2. **～た後で (〜ta ato de)**: This indicates that one action happens after another without the implication of it being the first occurrence.
   - Example: 食べた後で行く (tabeta ato de iku) - "I'll go after I have eaten."
### Key Differences
- ～てはじめて emphasizes that the second action could not occur without the completion of the first, often suggesting a new experience or realization.
- ～てから simply denotes a temporal sequence, while ～た後で indicates a post-action scenario without the same emphasis on the necessity of order.
