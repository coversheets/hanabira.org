## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Compared with Similar Grammar Points:
- **～たまま (たまま)**: This suggests something remains in a particular state but may not have the implication of action completion that たきり does.
  - Example: ドアを開けたまま (I left the door open).
  
- **～て以来 (ていらい)**: It indicates a period since a certain action was completed, with a focus on the ongoing state.
  - Example: 結婚して以来 (Since I got married).
### Key Difference:
- While たきり emphasizes the lack of further action after a completed act, ていらい indicates the beginning of the period without specifying a lack of action.
