## 1. Introduction
The phrase 何况 (hékùang) is a conjunction that is often used to introduce additional information, emphasizing a point or assertion that follows. It can be translated as "let alone," "moreover," or "much less" in English.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
何况 (hékùang) is typically used to introduce an example that strengthens a previous statement. It highlights a situation that is even more obvious or significant than what has just been mentioned. 
### Structure
- The structure generally follows:
  
  **A1 + 何况 + A2**
  
  - **A1** is usually a statement.
  - **A2** is a related statement that emphasizes an even greater point.
### Meaning and Formation
- **A** refers to general statements or situations.
- The use of 何况 suggests that if A1 is true, then A2, which is more significant, must also be true.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Differences with 相对 (xiāngduì)
- **相对 (xiāngduì)** means "relatively" or "comparatively," focusing on relative comparisons rather than emphasizing the contrast seen in 何况.
### Examples
- **相对:** 他学习得很努力，相对他还是有进步。(Tā xuéxí dé hěn nǔlì, xiāngduì tā háishi yǒu jìnbù.)      
  "He studies hard; relatively, he is making progress."
### Key Difference
- 何况 requires a stronger implied relationship between A1 and A2, whereas 相对 suggests less direct comparison.
