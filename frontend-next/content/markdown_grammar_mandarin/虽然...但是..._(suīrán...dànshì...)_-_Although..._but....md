## Comparative Analysis
This structure is similar to "although... yet..." in English. It's important to note that unlike in English, the use of "however" or "nevertheless" does not usually appear at the beginning of a sentence. 
### Other Comparative Structures
- **尽管...还是... (jǐnguǎn... háishi...)**: This structure also means "although... still...", but it indicates that the second clause persists despite the conditions laid out in the first clause.
  - Example: 尽管下雨，还是去跑步。 (Jǐnguǎn xiàyǔ, háishi qù pǎobù.) - Although it was raining, I still went jogging.
