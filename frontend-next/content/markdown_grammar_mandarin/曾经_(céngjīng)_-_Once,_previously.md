## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **以前 (yǐqián)**: Also means "before" or "previously." However, **以前** does not focus on completed actions; rather, it contextualizes a time before another event.
- **过 (guò)**: This is a grammatical aspect marker used to indicate experiences. However, it doesn't have the same emphasis on the "once" aspect as **曾经** does. For example, “我去过北京” focuses on the experience of going to Beijing; “我曾经去过北京” emphasizes that it was a past experience which is not the case now.
