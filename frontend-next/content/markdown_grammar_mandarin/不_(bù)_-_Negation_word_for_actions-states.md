## 5. Cultural Notes 
### Cultural Relevance
- In Chinese culture, politeness is significant, and using 不 can sometimes be softened by using alternative phrases to avoid sounding too direct or negative. For example, using a more indirect phrase like **没关系** (méi guānxi) which means "it's okay" can be preferable in some contexts.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- 不客气 (bù kèqi) - “You’re welcome” (literally “not polite”).
- 不知道 (bù zhīdào) - “I don’t know.”
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Common Mistake**: Using 不 to negate actions that have already been completed (should use 没).
  - Incorrect: 我不去了。 (Wǒ bù qùle.) [I do not go.]
  - Correct: 我没去。 (Wǒ méi qù.) [I did not go.]
  
### Learning Strategies
- Remember the distinction between 不 for general negation and 没 for past actions with a mnemonic: **不** starts with a **b**, just like the word “begin” (present) while **没** relates to something “missed” (past).
