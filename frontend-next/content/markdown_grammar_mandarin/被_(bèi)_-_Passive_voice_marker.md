# Grammar Point: 被 (bèi) - Passive Voice Marker
## 1. Introduction
The Chinese character **被 (bèi)** is utilized as a passive voice marker. In sentences that use 被, the subject receives the action rather than performing it. Understanding how to correctly use 被 is crucial for creating clear and effective sentences in Mandarin.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of a passive sentence in Mandarin that uses 被 is as follows: 
**Subject + 被 + Agent + Verb + (Object)**
- **Subject**: The person or thing that is affected by the action.
- **被**: The passive marker.
- **Agent**: The doer of the action (optional in informal contexts).
- **Verb**: The action being performed.
- **Object**: What the action is directed at (optional for clarity).

## 3. Comparative Analysis
In English, passive voice is often formed with variations of the verb "to be" plus the past participle (e.g., "The book was read"). In Mandarin, we use 被, which directly marks the passive nature of the verb.
### Key Differences
- **Flexibility**: Mandarin allows the omission of the agent (e.g., "书被读了" - "The book was read") if the doer is not important.
- **Indication of Action**: 被 specifically indicates suffering or adverse consequences, unlike its English counterpart.
## 4. Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples
1. **Formal Context**: 
   - **Sentence**: 会议被取消了。
   - **Translation**: The meeting was canceled.
   
2. **Informal Context**:
   - **Sentence**: 这道题被我做对了。
   - **Translation**: I got this question right.
3. **Written Context**:
   - **Sentence**: 这篇文章被很多人阅读。
   - **Translation**: This article was read by many people.
4. **Spoken Context**:
   - **Sentence**: 我的电脑被修好了。
   - **Translation**: My computer was fixed.
## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Chinese culture, it is often more polite to avoid stating the agent directly, especially in formal situations. This indirectness is seen as a way to show humility. 
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **被捧上天 (bèi pěng shàng tiān)**: "To be praised excessively" can illustrate how 被 portrays the position of the subject.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Mistake**: Learners often forget to include 了 (le) in completed actions.
  - **Incorrect**: 书被我读。
  - **Correct**: 书被我读了。
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Remember "被 is for being" to associate it with passive structure. Visualize the subject being "held" or "affected" by the action.
