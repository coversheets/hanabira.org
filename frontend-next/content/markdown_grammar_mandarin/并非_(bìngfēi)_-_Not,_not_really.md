# 并非 (bìngfēi) - Not, Not Really
## 1. Introduction
"并非" (bìngfēi) is a phrase in Mandarin that means "not" or "not really." It is often used to emphasize negation, contrasting what one might think or expect. This grammar point is typically found in more formal or literary contexts.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
"并非" is constructed from two parts:
- **并** (bìng) - meaning "and," but in this context, it adds emphasis to the following word.
- **非** (fēi) - meaning "not" or "is not."
When combined, "并非" serves to strongly indicate that something is not the case, often in rebuttal to a misconception. 
### Structure and Formation
The general structure for using "并非" is:
```
Subject + 并非 + Predicate
```
### Visual Aids
Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate its placement in a sentence:
```

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar Points
- **不是** (bù shì): This means "is not." Unlike "并非," which adds a layer of emphasis and is more formal, "不是" is commonly used in everyday conversation.
  
- **并没有** (bìng méiyǒu): This means "not at all" and emphasizes that something does not exist. While "并没有" applies more to existence or presence, "并非" focuses more on negating a statement or assumption.
