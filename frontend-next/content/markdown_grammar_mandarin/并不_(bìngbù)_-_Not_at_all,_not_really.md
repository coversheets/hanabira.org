## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
**并不** is composed of two parts:
- **并** (bìng): which means "together" or "not really" when used to negate.
- **不** (bù): which is the negation word for "not."
### Meaning, Structure, Formation
**Structure:**
- **Subject + 并不 + Verb/Adjective**
**Formation Diagram:**
```
Subject → 并不 → Verb/Adjective
```
### Example Breakdown:
- 我并不喜欢这个电影。  
  (Wǒ bìngbù xǐhuān zhège diànyǐng.)  
  "I do not really like this movie."
In this sentence, 并不 suggests that the speaker's feelings towards the movie are not as strong as implied.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
**与** (yǔ) vs. **并不** (bìngbù): 
- **与** translates to "and" in English, often linking statements, while **并不** emphasizes a negation.
  
- Example:
  - 他和我都不喜欢这个。  
    (Tā hé wǒ dōu bù xǐhuān zhège.)  
    "He and I both do not like this."
In contrast:
- 这并不是我想要的。  
  (Zhè bìng bù shì wǒ xiǎng yào de.)  
  "This is not at all what I want."
This highlights the difference in usage, where 并不 underscores an emphatic denial.
