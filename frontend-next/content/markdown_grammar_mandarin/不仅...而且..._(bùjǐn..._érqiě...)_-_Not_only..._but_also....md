## 1. Introduction
The structure "不仅...而且..." is used to connect two clauses or phrases to emphasize that not only one condition is true, but an additional one is also true. This grammar structure enhances the richness of expression in Mandarin, allowing speakers to convey a more layered meaning.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure consists of two parts:
- **不仅 (bùjǐn)**: This means "not only." It introduces the first part of the statement.
- **而且 (érqiě)**: This means "but also." It connects the first part with the additional statement.
### Structure Formation
```
Not only + [first statement] + but also + [second statement]
```

------------------------------------------------
| 不仅 (bùjǐn)       | 而且 (érqiě)        |
| (Not only)         | (but also)         |
------------------------------------------------
```
### Meaning
This structure expresses the idea that the second clause is true in addition to the first clause, highlighting the significance or merit of both aspects.
## 3. Comparative Analysis
This structure can be compared to other conjunctions like "也" (yě - also) and "和" (hé - and), but "不仅...而且..." specifically serves to emphasize the additive nature of both elements with a stronger contrast.
### Differences:
- **也 (yě)** is more neutral and simply indicates inclusion.
- **和 (hé)** connects items without emphasizing the contrast or additional value.
