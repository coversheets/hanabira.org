## Introduction
In Mandarin Chinese, the phrase **尽管如此** (jǐnguǎn rúcǐ) is used to express a contrast between two statements, similar to saying "even so" or "nevertheless" in English. This grammar point allows the speaker to acknowledge a situation while highlighting that the subsequent action or opinion remains unchanged despite that situation.
## Core Grammar Explanation

- **尽管** (jǐnguǎn) means "despite" or "even though" and introduces a clause that states the reason or circumstance.

Putting these two together, **尽管如此** can be understood as "despite this (situation), ..." or "even so, ...".
