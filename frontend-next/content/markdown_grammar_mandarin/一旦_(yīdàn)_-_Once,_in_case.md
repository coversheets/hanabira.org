---
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
**一旦 (yīdàn)** is used to introduce a condition and indicate that the subsequent outcome will follow if that condition is satisfied. It emphasizes the notion that once a specific event occurs, a certain consequence is anticipated or forewarned.
### Structure
The typical structure for using 一旦 is:
```
一旦 + Condition + 就 + Result
```
Where:
- **一旦** (yīdàn) introduces the condition.
- **就** (jiù) indicates that a consequence follows from that condition.
- **Condition** is the situation being discussed.
- **Result** is the expected outcome.

## Comparative Analysis
**Similar Grammar Points:**
- **如果 (rúguǒ)** - "if": This expresses a conditional relation but doesn't have the same emphasis as 一旦. 
  - Example: 如果你去，我就去。 (If you go, I will go.)
  
- **一旦 (yīdàn)** is stronger in emphasizing the certainty of the result when the condition occurs:
  - Example: 一旦你迟到，会议就会开始。 (Once you are late, the meeting will start.)
Thus, 一旦 suggests that the result is very likely or expected following the condition.
