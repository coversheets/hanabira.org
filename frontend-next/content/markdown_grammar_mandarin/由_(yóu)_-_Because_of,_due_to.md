## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **与 (yǔ)**: while both 由 and 与 indicate relationships, 由 focuses on causality ("due to"), whereas 与 means "and" and connects two elements.
- **因为 (yīnwèi)**: 与 expresses a reason for an action while 由 places more emphasis on the cause. Therefore, while 由 sets a tone of causation, 因为 emphasizes the reasoning process.
