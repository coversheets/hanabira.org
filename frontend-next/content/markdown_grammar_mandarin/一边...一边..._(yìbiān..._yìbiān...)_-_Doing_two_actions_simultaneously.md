# 一边...一边... (yìbiān... yìbiān...) - Doing Two Actions Simultaneously
## Introduction
The structure 一边...一边... (yìbiān... yìbiān...) is used in Mandarin to express actions that are occurring simultaneously. It is similar to the English phrase "while" or "doing... at the same time."
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure consists of two main components:
- **一边** (yìbiān) - "one side" or "one aspect"
- The action verb that follows it, which indicates what action is being done.
The formula is:
```
Subject + 一边 + Verb1 + 一边 + Verb2
```
This means the subject is engaging in Verb1 and Verb2 at the same time.
### Meaning, Structure, Formation Diagram
In terms of structure and meaning:
- **一边 (yìbiān)** marks the first action.
- The second **一边 (yìbiān)** refers to the second action being performed concurrently.
**Example Structure:**
```
我 (Wǒ - I) + 一边 (yìbiān) + 吃 (chī - eat) + 一边 (yìbiān) + 看电视 (kàn diànshì - watch TV).
```
**Translation:** I eat while watching TV.
