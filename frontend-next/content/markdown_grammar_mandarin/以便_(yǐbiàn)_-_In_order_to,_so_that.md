## Introduction
The phrase 以便 (yǐbiàn) is used to express purpose or intent, translating to "in order to" or "so that" in English. It introduces an action that is aimed at achieving a specific goal.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **以便 (yǐbiàn)** indicates the purpose of an action or the reason behind it. 
- It connects two clauses: the first clause states the action, and the second clause states the intended result.
### Structure
- The structure typically follows this pattern:
  - **[Action] 以便 [Purpose/Result]**
- For example: 
  - 我学习中文，以便能跟中国人交流。
    - (Wǒ xuéxí zhōngwén, yǐbiàn néng gēn zhōngguó rén jiāoliú.)
    - Translation: I study Chinese in order to be able to communicate with Chinese people.
### Formation Diagram
```plaintext
[Subject] + [Action] + 以便 + [Purpose/Result]
```
- Example: 
  ```plaintext
  我                  学习中文             以便               能跟中国人交流。
  (I)                (study Chinese)      (in order to)  (be able to communicate with Chinese people.)
  ```
## Comparative Analysis
- **Similar Grammar Points:**
  - **为了 (wèile):** This is another way to express purpose. Both 以便 and 为了 can often be used interchangeably, but 以便 is more formal.
  - **从而 (cóng'ér):** This means "thus," "thereby," or "so as to." However, it does not connect a purpose with an action as 以便 does—it emphasizes the result of an action rather than the purpose.
*Example Comparison:*
- 我学习中文为了能跟中国人交流。
- 我学习中文以便能跟中国人交流。
Both sentences mean "I study Chinese in order to communicate with Chinese people," but the first is slightly less formal than the second.
