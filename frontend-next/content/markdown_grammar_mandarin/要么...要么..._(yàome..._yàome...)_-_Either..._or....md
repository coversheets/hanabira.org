## 3. Comparative Analysis
Unlike **或者 (huòzhě)** which means "or" in a more neutral sense (where both options can coexist), **要么...要么...** indicates a choice where only one of the options is valid at one time. 
- **或者** (huòzhě) - Can be used for non-exclusive options.
  
  Example: 你想喝茶或者咖啡？(Nǐ xiǎng hē chá huòzhě kāfēi?) - Do you want tea or coffee? (both options can be accepted)
- **要么...要么...** - Implies a strict either/or choice.
  Example: 你要么去看电影，要么留在家里。(Nǐ yàome qù kàn diànyǐng, yàome liú zài jiālǐ.) - You either go to the movies, or stay at home. (only one option can be chosen)
