# 不仅...还... (bùjǐn...hái...) - Not only... but also...
## 1. Introduction
In this lesson, we will explore the grammar structure "不仅...还..." (bùjǐn...hái...), which is used to express that not only is one statement true, but an additional statement is also true. This structure adds emphasis and is commonly used in both spoken and written Mandarin.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: The structure "不仅...还..." is used to indicate that more than one condition or statement is applicable. It emphasizes that something is more significant than just its initial quality.
- **Structure**: 
  - 不仅 (bùjǐn) - "not only"
  - 还 (hái) - "but also"
#### Formation Diagram
```
不仅 + A + 还 + B
```
Where:
- A is the first statement
- B is the second statement that is equally true or additional.
### Example:
- **English**: Not only is she beautiful, but she is also intelligent.
- **Mandarin**: 她不仅漂亮，还聪明。(Tā bùjǐn piàoliang, hái cōngmíng.)
## 3. Comparative Analysis
This structure is similar to "不仅而且" (bùjǐn érqiě) - "not only but also", but "还" (hái) can give a slightly less formal tone. The use of "而且" (érqiě) often conveys a more serious or formal context.
### Example Comparison:
- 不仅...还... (bùjǐn...hái...)
  - 她不仅喜欢旅游，还喜欢摄影。(She not only likes to travel, but also photography.)
  
- 不仅...而且... (bùjǐn...érqiě...)
  - 她不仅喜欢旅游，而且喜欢摄影。(She not only likes to travel, but also photography, but this appears more formal.)
