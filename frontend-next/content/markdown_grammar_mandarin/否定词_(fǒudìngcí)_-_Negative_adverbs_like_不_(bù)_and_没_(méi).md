## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Chinese culture, politeness is paramount. Using 不 (bù) might sound too direct in certain contexts, while 没 (méi) offers a softer approach when speaking about past actions, allowing you to convey messages without offending.
### Levels of Politeness
- When refusing offers or invitations, especially in formal settings, it's recommended to use 没 (méi) as it sounds more polite.
  
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **不见不散 (bù jiàn bú sàn)** - "We won’t leave until we see each other." (An idiom indicating a commitment to meet.)
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips

2. Forgetting the context:
   - Using 不 (bù) for completed actions leads to misunderstandings.
### Learning Strategies
