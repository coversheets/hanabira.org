## Comparative Analysis
This structure can be compared to the usage of **如果 (rúguǒ)** meaning "if", which is more general and does not emphasize exclusivity. 
- **如果...就... (rúguǒ...jiù...)**: If... then...
- **只有...才... (zhǐyǒu...cái...)**: Only if... then...
### Example Comparison:
- 如果你来，我就会很高兴。
  - (If you come, I will be very happy.)
  
- 只有你来，我才会很高兴。
  - (Only if you come, then I will be very happy.)
The second example emphasizes that the speaker's happiness is strictly contingent upon the person coming.
