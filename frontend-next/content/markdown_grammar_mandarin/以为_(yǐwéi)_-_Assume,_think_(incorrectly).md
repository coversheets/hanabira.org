## Cultural Notes

In Chinese culture, it's important to be aware of assumptions regarding others' thoughts or actions, as making incorrect assumptions can lead to misunderstandings. Using "以为" appropriately conveys humility by acknowledging an erroneous assumption. 
### Levels of Politeness
The structure can be used in both formal and informal contexts, but it is generally polite to clarify misunderstandings in social interactions.
### Idiomatic Expressions

2. **Incorrect Use of Tone**: Ensure that pronunciation and tones are correct to avoid misunderstandings.
