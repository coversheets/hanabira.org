### Similar Grammar Points:
- **和 (hé)**: Also means "and," but is primarily used for simple lists or agreements, without the contrasting nuance of "而."
- **但是 (dànshì)**: Means "but," often used at the beginning of a sentence or after a comma, while "而" can connect clauses more fluidly in the middle of a sentence.
**Example Comparison**:
- 你爱我和我爱你。(You love me, and I love you.) — using 和.
- 你爱我，但是我不爱你。(You love me, but I don't love you.) — using 但是.
- 你爱我，而我则不爱你。(You love me, and I, on the other hand, do not love you.) — using 而 for a nuanced contrast.
