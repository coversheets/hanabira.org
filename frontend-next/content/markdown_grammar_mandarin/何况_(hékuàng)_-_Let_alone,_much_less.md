# Grammar Point: 何况 (hékuàng) - Let alone, Much less
## 1. Introduction
In Mandarin Chinese, the phrase 何况 (hékuàng) is used to indicate that if something is true or applicable in one case, it is even more so in another, usually more extreme, case. It can be understood as "let alone" or "much less" in English. 
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
何况 is commonly used in situations where the speaker wants to emphasize that a second statement is more obvious or extreme than a first statement. It is used to indicate that if the first statement is valid, then the second statement follows logically and is even more applicable.
### Structure and Formation
The structure with 何况 typically follows this pattern:
**[Condition] + 何况 (hékuàng) + [More Extreme Condition]**

## 3. Comparative Analysis

**Comparison Example**:  
- 这个问题我都回答不了，何况他。  
  (I cannot answer this question, let alone him.)  
- 这个问题我更不用说，他可能连题目都看不懂。  
  (I don’t even need to mention this question; he probably wouldn’t even understand the problem.)
## 4. Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples

## 5. Cultural Notes

### Idiomatic Expressions

   (You can't even understand this book, much less those technical ones.)
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
