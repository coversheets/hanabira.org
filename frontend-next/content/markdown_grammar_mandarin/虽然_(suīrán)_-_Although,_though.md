## 3. Comparative Analysis
While 虽然 (suīrán) means "although," it has a specific nuance. For example:
- 但是 (dànshì) means "but." It can be used to introduce a contrasting idea but doesn't necessarily imply concession.
- 虽然 (suīrán) always suggests that the first idea is acknowledged but doesn’t alter the fact of the second idea.
### Key Difference
- 虽然...但是 (suīrán...dànshì) is more formal and emphasizes the contrast. 
- 但 (dàn) can be used as a less formal alternative in spoken Chinese.
