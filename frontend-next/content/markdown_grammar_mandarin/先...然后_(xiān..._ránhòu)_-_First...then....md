## Introduction
The structure "先...然后" (xiān... ránhòu) is used to describe a sequence of actions where one action occurs first, followed by another action. This grammar point is essential for expressing order in both spoken and written Mandarin.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure consists of two parts:
1. **先 (xiān)** - This means "first" or "before."
2. **然后 (ránhòu)** - This means "then" or "after that."
**Structure:**
```
先 + Action 1 + 然后 + Action 2
```
### Meaning, Structure, Formation Diagram
When using this structure, you indicate that the first action is completed before the second action begins. Here’s a simple breakdown:
| Part       | Meaning       |
|------------|---------------|
| 先         | First         |
| Action 1   | The first action to be performed |
| 然后       | Then          |
| Action 2   | The second action to be performed |
**Example Structure:**
```
先去超市，然后回家。
First go to the supermarket, then go home.
```
## Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar Points
1. **在...之后 (zài... zhīhòu)** - This means "after" and focuses on the order of actions without the implication of "first."
   - Example: 我们吃饭在电影之后。(Wǒmen chīfàn zài diànyǐng zhīhòu.) - We eat after the movie.
2. **先...再 (xiān... zài)** - This means "first... and then," where "再" implies another action following the second one.
   - Example: 先洗手，再吃饭。(Xiān xǐshǒu, zài chīfàn.) - First wash your hands, and then eat.
While "先... 然后" is used to show a sequence of two actions, "先... 再" implies a continuation of multiple actions.
