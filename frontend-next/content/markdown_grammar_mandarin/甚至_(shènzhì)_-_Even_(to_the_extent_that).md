## 1. Introduction
The word "甚至" (shènzhì) is a Mandarin Chinese conjunction used to express a sense of extremity or inclusiveness, meaning "even" or "to the extent that". It emphasizes a situation that is surprising or unexpected, often enhancing the degree of what is being discussed.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
"甚至" is used to indicate that what follows is an example that is more extreme than what was previously mentioned. It often prepares the listener for an unexpected piece of information.
### Structure

- A + 甚至 + B
Where:
- A is the initial idea or context,
- B is the surprising or extreme example.

**Example:**

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Expressions
- **连 (lián)**: This also means "even" but is typically used for more immediate relationships.
  - Example: 他连这个都不知道。
  - (Tā lián zhège dōu bù zhīdào.)
  - "He doesn’t even know this."
  
- **还 (hái)**: Can indicate "still" or "also", but lacks the extremity of "甚至".
  - Example: 他们还去看电影。
  - (Tāmen hái qù kàn diànyǐng.)
  - "They also went to see a movie."
**Distinction:** "甚至" adds a layer of extremity that "连" and "还" do not convey.
