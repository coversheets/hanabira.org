## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison to "不过" (búguò)
- **虽然** is typically more formal and acknowledges a concession, while **不过** is more casual, suggesting a mild contrast without the same level of acknowledgment.
**Example**:
- 虽然我累了，但是我还要工作。  
  (Although I am tired, I still want to work.)
- 我累了，不过我还要工作。  
  (I am tired, but I still want to work.)
### Comparison to "即使" (jíshǐ)
- **即使** means "even if" and introduces a conditional aspect rather than a simple contrast.
**Example**:
- 即使我有很多钱，我也不想买这个。  
  (Even if I have a lot of money, I don't want to buy this.)
