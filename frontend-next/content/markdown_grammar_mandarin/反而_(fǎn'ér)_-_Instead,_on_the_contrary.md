### Levels of Politeness and Formality
While using 反而 can seem straightforward, adding it in your conversation shows a level of sophistication that reflects a good understanding of discussion nuances in Mandarin.

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Common Mistake**: Confusing the usage of 反而 with 就 (jiù), which can also indicate results but doesn’t inherently express contrast.
- **Correction Tip**: Always ensure that the statement following 反而 is contrary or unexpected. 
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Remember 反 (fǎn - opposite) as "reverse" and 而 (ér - and, but) as "but," thus linking 反而 to the idea of "but on the contrary."
