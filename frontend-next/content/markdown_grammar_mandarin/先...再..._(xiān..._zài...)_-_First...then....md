## 3. Comparative Analysis
The 先...再... structure is similar to the English "First... then..." sequence. However, unlike English, which might often use conjunctions like "and" for similar sequences, Mandarin requires the clear markers of 先 and 再 to describe the order of operations.
### Differences from Other Structures
- **先...再... vs. 先...然后... (xiān... ránhòu...)**: Both structures mean "first... then..." but 先...再... is often preferred for simpler, direct sequences, while 先...然后... may imply more complex or longer actions.
