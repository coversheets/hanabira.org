## Comparative Analysis
- **像 (xiàng)**: While 似的 (shì de) can sometimes be interchanged with 像 (xiàng), 像 is generally a simpler way to say "like." For example, "他像一个医生" means "He is like a doctor," but it doesn't imply the same degree of similarity as 似的.
### Nuances:
- **似乎 (sì hū)**: This means "seems" or "appears," but it refers more to perceptions than to similarities. For example, "似乎下雨了" means "It seems like it’s going to rain."
