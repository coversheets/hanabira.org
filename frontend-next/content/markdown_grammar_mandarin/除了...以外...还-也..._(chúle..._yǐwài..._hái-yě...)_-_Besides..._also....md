- **与/和 (yǔ/hé)**: Both mean "and" in Chinese and do not include the notion of "besides" or "in addition to."
- **不但...而且... (bùdàn... érqiě...)**: This structure expresses "not only... but also...", which is more restrictive and emphasizes qualifications for both clauses. 除了...以外... adds further information to already stated points.
