The structure 连...都/也... is used in Mandarin to emphasize something surprising or unexpected by stating that even the most basic or expected element is included. It translates to "even" in English. This structure can help express extremes or highlight how something extends beyond the norm.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **连 (lián)**: This means "even" and is used to introduce the element that is surprising.
- **都 (dōu) / 也 (yě)**: Both mean "all" or "also." They typically follow the subject or the indicated element.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
This structure can often be confused with 甚至 (shènzhì), which also conveys an inclusive meaning of "even" but is used to denote something that is extreme or unexpected in a different way. 
- **连...都...** focuses on basic inclusiveness.
- **甚至 (shènzhì)** emphasizes extreme cases or emphasizes the extent of the situation.
### Example:
- **连他也来了。(lián tā yě lái le)** - "Even he came."
- **甚至他也来了。(shènzhì tā yě lái le)** - "He even came."
In the first sentence, it emphasizes that even the least expected, "he," came; in the second, it suggests that his arrival was surprising and noteworthy.
