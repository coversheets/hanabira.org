## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Structure**: The structure of "非...不可" consists of the adverb "非" (fēi), meaning "not," and "不可" (bùkě), meaning "cannot." When combined, the phrase conveys that something must occur or be done.
### Breakdown of the structure:
- **非 (fēi)**: Indicates negation or something that is not available as a choice.
- **...**: A placeholder for a noun, verb, or situation that is essential.

### Key Differences:
- **非...不可** carries a stronger emphasis and is slightly more formal compared to **必须** and **得**.
