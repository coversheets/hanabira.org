  ```
  subject + 比 + subject + adjective
  ```
  - Example: 她比我聪明 (She is smarter than I am).
- **不如 (bùrú)** emphasizes inferiority rather than just comparison, making it more definitive.
## Examples in Context

   - (This plan is not as good as that plan.)
   
2. **Informal:**

## Cultural Notes

### Idiomatic Expressions

## Common Mistakes and Tips

  - **Tip**: Remember that 不如 emphasizes inferiority instead of merely comparing quantities or qualities.
  
### Learning Strategies

- Practice forming sentences in real scenarios to grasp usage better.
## Summary and Review
### Key Takeaways
- 不如 means "not as good as" and is used for comparison.
