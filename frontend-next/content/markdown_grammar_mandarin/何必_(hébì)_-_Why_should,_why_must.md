### Detailed Explanation

  - 不必 (bùbì): This also means "not necessary" and is often used in a more straightforward manner to state that something does not need to be done.

## 5. Cultural Notes

### Idiomatic Expressions
- 何必如此 (hébì rúcǐ): "Why must it be this way?" is often used to question someone's stern approach in a conversation.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Frequent Errors**:
  - Using 何必 in positive statements instead of questioning the necessity, e.g., saying "你何必去" (Nǐ hébì qù) - "Why must you go?" may confuse learners since it implies that it is necessary to go.
  
### Learning Strategies
