## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **一直 (yīzhí) vs. 还 (hái)**: 还 indicates "still" but does not imply the same continuous duration as 一直. For example, 我还在家 (wǒ hái zài jiā) means "I am still at home," suggesting a current state without the implication of prior duration.
  
- **一直 (yīzhí) vs. 继续 (jìxù)**: 继续 means "to continue" and often focuses on the action of continuing rather than the ongoing aspect. For instance, 我继续工作 (wǒ jìxù gōngzuò) means "I continue to work" but does not suggest that the action has been happening all along.
