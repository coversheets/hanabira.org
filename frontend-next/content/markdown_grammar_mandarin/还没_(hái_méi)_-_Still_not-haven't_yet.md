# Grammar Point: 还没 (hái méi) - Still not / Haven't yet
## 1. Introduction
The phrase "还没" (hái méi) is frequently used in Mandarin Chinese to indicate that something has not happened up to the present moment. It conveys a sense of continuation or ongoing expectation.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
"还没" is a combination of two components:
- **还 (hái)**: means "still" or "yet"
- **没 (méi)**: negates the verb, meaning "not" or "have not"
Together, they form a structure that indicates that an action or event has not yet occurred.
### Structure
The typical structure for using "还没" is:
```
Subject + 还没 + Verb + (Object)
```
### Formation Diagram
```
[Subject] + 还没 + [Verb] + [Object]
     (hái méi)    
```
## 3. Comparative Analysis
"还没" is often compared with other negation phrases:
- **没 (méi)**: Just "not" or "didn't" without the meaning of "yet." 
  - Example: 我没吃 (wǒ méi chī) - I didn’t eat (implies it's a completed action).
  
- **还没有 (hái méi yǒu)**: This is a more formal way of saying "still not" or "haven't yet," which is used in formal writing or speeches.
**Key Difference:**
* "还没" indicates ongoing relevance in the present, while "没" refers to a completed negation.
