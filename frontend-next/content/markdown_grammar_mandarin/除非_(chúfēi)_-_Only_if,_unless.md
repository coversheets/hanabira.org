## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Vs. 如果 (rúguǒ)**: 
  - 如果 means "if" and can be used in a more straightforward conditional statement:
    - 如果你来，我就去。(If you come, I will go.)
  - 除非 emphasizes that the result will not happen without the condition.
  
- **Vs. 假如 (jiǎrú)**: 
  - 假如 also means "if" but is more hypothetical:
    - 假如你有钱，你会买什么？(If you had money, what would you buy?)
  - 除非 is used for conditions that need to be true for something to happen.
