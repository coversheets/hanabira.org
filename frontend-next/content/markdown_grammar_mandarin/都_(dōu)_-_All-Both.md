## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips

   - Incorrect: 我都喜欢 (Wǒ dōu xǐhuān) – This suggests "I all like" instead of "I like all of them."
  
2. **Confusing with "也" (yě)**: Learners sometimes mix these up. Remember that "也" does not imply totality.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Remember "都 = All" by linking "都" (dōu) with "Do" for "do all."
  
## 7. Summary and Review
### Key Takeaways
- "都" (dōu) means "all" or "both" and expresses inclusivity in Mandarin.
