## 1. Introduction
In Mandarin Chinese, "由此" (yóucǐ) is a phrase used to denote causation or consequence. It translates to "thus" or "hence" in English and is commonly employed to link information, drawing a logical conclusion from previously stated facts.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
"由此" is made up of two characters:
- **由 (yóu)**: meaning "by" or "from"
- **此 (cǐ)**: meaning "this"
Together, "由此" implies "from this point" or "from this (evidence)" leading to a conclusion.
### Structure
1. **Causal Relationship**: It connects a reason or evidence to a conclusion.
2. **Placement**: "由此" typically appears at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
