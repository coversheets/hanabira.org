## Introduction
The phrase "只有…才…" is a Chinese grammatical structure used to express that one condition or event is the prerequisite for another to happen. It can be translated as "only if" or "only when" to indicate exclusivity in the cause-and-effect relationship between two actions or situations.

This structure emphasizes that the second action or situation will only occur if the first condition is satisfied.

   - 只有 (zhǐyǒu) - Only if
   - Subject 1 + 只有 + Condition + 才 (cái) - then
   - Subject 2 + Result
