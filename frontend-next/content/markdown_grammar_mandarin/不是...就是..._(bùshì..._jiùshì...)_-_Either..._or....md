## Introduction
The structure 不是...就是... is commonly used in Mandarin Chinese to express a situation where there are two possibilities or alternatives. It translates to "either... or..." in English. This grammar point is particularly useful for making distinctions or choices between two options.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure consists of two key parts:
1. **不是 (bù shì)**: This means "is not" and is used to negate the first option.
2. **就是 (jiù shì)**: This means "is precisely" or "is simply" and introduces the second option.
#### Structure
The basic structure is:
```
S + 不是 + Option 1 + 就是 + Option 2
```
- **S**: Subject (the person or thing being discussed)
- **Option 1**: The first possibility
- **Option 2**: The second possibility

### Differences
