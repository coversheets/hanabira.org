### Levels of Politeness and Formality
Using 替代 in a formal context (like business settings) showcases professionalism. In casual conversations, it works just as well, but the tone may be lighter.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **替天行道 (tì tiān xíng dào):** To act on behalf of heaven in seeking justice.
- **代人买单 (dài rén mǎidān):** To pay on someone else's behalf.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- A frequent mistake is using 替代 when talking about exchanging physical items, where 替换 is more suitable.
- Confusing 替代 with 代替 for roles – remember, 替代 is more for functional replacement rather than taking over a person’s position.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:** Think of 替代 as "t代," where "t" represents "to take." This can help you remember that it is primarily about substituting or replacing.
## 7. Summary and Review
### Key Takeaways
- 替代 means “to replace” or “to be on behalf of.”
