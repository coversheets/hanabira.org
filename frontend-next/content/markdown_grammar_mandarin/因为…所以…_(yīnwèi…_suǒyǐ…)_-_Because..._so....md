## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Omitting "所以"**: Learners might use only 因为 to state a reason without conveying the result. 
   - Incorrect: 因为我饿了 (Yīnwèi wǒ è le).
   - Correct: 因为我饿了，所以我想吃饭 (Yīnwèi wǒ è le, suǒyǐ wǒ xiǎng chīfàn).
   - Translation: "Because I am hungry, I want to eat."
2. **Mixing up order**: Always start with **因为** before stating the cause. The structure cannot be swapped without changing the meaning.
