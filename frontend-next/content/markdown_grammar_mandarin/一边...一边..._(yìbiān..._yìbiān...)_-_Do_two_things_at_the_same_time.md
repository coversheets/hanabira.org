- **同时 (tóngshí)**: This means "at the same time" but is used for more formal contexts and does not emphasize the two actions occurring in a personal way.
- **边 (biān)**: Without 一边, this can indicate the side or aspect of something and does not denote simultaneous actions.
### Differences:
- **一边...一边...** focuses on actions performed by the subject, while **同时** is more neutral and can refer to events happening in parallel without a personal subject.
