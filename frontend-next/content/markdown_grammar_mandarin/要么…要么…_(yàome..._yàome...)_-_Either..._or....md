## 3. Comparative Analysis
The **要么...要么...** structure has similarities with **或者 (huòzhě)**, which also means "or." However, the key difference lies in the usage:
- **要么...要么...**: Implies a more exclusive choice between two options.
- **或者 (huòzhě)**: Can be used for broader choices and does not emphasize that only one option can be true.
### Example Comparison
- **要么你去， 要么我去。** (Either you go, or I go.) - Exclusive choice.
- **你可能去商店，或者去市场。** (You might go to the store, or you might go to the market.) - Non-exclusive choice.
