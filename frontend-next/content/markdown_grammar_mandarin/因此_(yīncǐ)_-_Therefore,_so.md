# Detailed Grammar Explanation: 因此 (yīncǐ) - Therefore, So
## 1. Introduction
The word 因此 (yīncǐ) is a conjunction in Mandarin Chinese that translates to "therefore" or "so" in English. It is used to indicate a consequence or a result derived from a preceding statement, similar to how we use "therefore" in English.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation 
### Detailed Explanation
**因此 (yīncǐ)** is used to connect clauses logically, showing that one statement is a result or conclusion of the previous one. It helps in creating a clear relationship between cause and effect.
### Structure
The basic structure using 因此 is as follows:
- **Statement A** (cause) + **因此** + **Statement B** (result)
### Formation Diagram
```
[Statement A] + 因此 + [Statement B]
```
## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **和 (hé)**: Used to mean "and," simply connecting two related statements without implication of cause/effect.
- **所以 (suǒyǐ)**: Also means "so" or "therefore," but is often placed at the beginning of the result clause instead of after the cause.
### Key Differences

|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Used for formal writing/speech  | Common in spoken Mandarin  | Simple conjunction |
