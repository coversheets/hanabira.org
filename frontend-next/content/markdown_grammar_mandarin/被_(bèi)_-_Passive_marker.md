# 被 (bèi) - Passive Marker
## 1. Introduction
In Mandarin Chinese, 被 (bèi) is a passive marker that is used to indicate that the subject of a sentence is the recipient of an action rather than the doer. This grammar point helps emphasize the action received by the subject.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: The character 被 (bèi) signals that the subject is acted upon, often replacing the active voice with a passive structure. It translates to "by" in English when indicating the doer of the action.
  
- **Structure**: The structure of a sentence using 被 (bèi) typically follows this pattern:
  
    ```
    Subject + 被 + Agent + Verb + (Complement)
    ```
- **Formation Diagram**:
  
    ```markdown
    [Subject]  +  被  +  [Agent]  +  [Verb]  +  [Complement]
    ```

| Verb      | Action taken                   | 打 (dǎ - hit)     |

## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Active Voice vs. Passive Voice**: In active voice, the focus is on the subject performing the action, whereas in passive voice, the focus shifts to the subject receiving the action.
  - **Active**: 她打了他们。 (She hit them.)
  - **Passive**: 她被他们打了。 (She was hit by them.)
  
- **Other Passive Constructions**: Besides 被 (bèi), the structure 可以 (kěyǐ - can) can also indicate passivity but with a focus on permission or possibility.
## 4. Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples:
1. **Formal**: 
   - 这本书被老师批改了。 
   - (This book was corrected by the teacher.)
2. **Informal**:

## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Chinese culture, passivity can sometimes reflect humility or a non-confrontational attitude. Using the passive voice with 被 (bèi) can also be a way to downplay the responsibility of the doer, which might be important in sensitive contexts.
### Levels of Politeness
Using 被 (bèi) can show respect for the subject, as it puts them in the position of receiving rather than performing.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- 被动 (bèidòng) - "to be in a passive state" or "passive," indicating a lack of initiative.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Not identifying the agent**: Beginners often forget to include or specify the agent.
- **Misplacing 被 (bèi)**: It should always come directly after the subject.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic**: Remember “被” as "being acted upon" - both begin with "be."
- **Practice Rewriting**: Take active sentences and convert them to passive using 被 (bèi) to reinforce understanding.
