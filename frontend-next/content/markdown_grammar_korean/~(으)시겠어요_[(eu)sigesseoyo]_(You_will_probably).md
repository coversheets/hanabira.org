## Introduction
The Korean expression ~(으)시겠어요 is a grammatical structure used to express a polite suggestion, a request for confirmation, or a proposal regarding someone's intention or future action. It is often translated as "Would you like to…?" or "Will you…?" in English.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure ~(으)시겠어요 is composed of the following components:
- **Verb stem**: the base form of a verb without the 다 ending.
- **-(으)시**: a suffix that indicates respect or politeness towards the subject (typically the listener).
- **겠어요**: indicates the intention, future possibility, or willingness of the speaker. 
### Structure
The structure can be broken down as follows:
1. **Identify the verb stem**: Take the infinitive form of the verb.
2. **Add the honorific suffix**: Use 시 (if the verb stem ends in a vowel) or 으시 (if the verb stem ends in a consonant) to denote respect.
3. **Add the future intention ending**: Attach 겠어요 to express the suggestion or proposal.
### Examples of Verb Stem and Usage
- 가다 (to go) → 가시겠어요? (Would you like to go?)
- 먹다 (to eat) → 드시겠어요? (Would you like to eat?)
- 하다 (to do) → 하시겠어요? (Would you like to do it?)
