# Grammar Explanation: (으)ㄴ/는 것 같다 [(eu)n/neun geot gatda] 
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point (으)ㄴ/는 것 같다 is commonly used in Korean to express conjecture or to suggest that something seems to be a certain way. It's a way to share an interpretation or assumption without asserting it as a fact.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation 
### Detailed Explanation
- **(으)ㄴ/는 것 같다** is made up of three parts:
  - **(으)ㄴ/는**: This is a suffix that attaches to verbs or adjectives.
    - For descriptive verbs (adjectives), you add **-ㄴ**.
    - For action verbs, you add **-는**.
  - **것**: This means "thing" or "fact". When combined with the previous part, it effectively changes the meaning to "the fact that..."
  - **같다**: This translates to "to seem" or "to be like".
### Structure
1. **Descriptive Verb (Adjective)**
   - Attach **-ㄴ** to the stem.
   - Example: *맑다* (to be clear) → *맑은 것 같다* (It seems to be clear).
   
2. **Action Verb**
   - Attach **-는** to the stem.
   - Example: *하다* (to do) → *하는 것 같다* (It seems like [someone is] doing).
