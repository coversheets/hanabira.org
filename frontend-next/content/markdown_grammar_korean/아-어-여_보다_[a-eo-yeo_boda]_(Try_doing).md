## 1. Introduction
The grammar structure 아/어/여 보다 is used in Korean to express the idea of "trying to do" something. It allows the speaker to indicate that they have made an effort or intention to do a specific action, often suggesting an attempt or experience. This construction can be quite useful in everyday conversations to convey curiosity, experimentation, or the act of attempting something new.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure 아/어/여 보다 is formed by taking a verb stem and combining it with the appropriate ending (아, 어, 여) based on the last vowel of the verb stem, followed by 보다. 
#### Formation Breakdown:
1. Determine the verb stem by removing the 다 (da) ending from the verb.
2. Check the last vowel of the verb stem:
   - If the last vowel is 아 (a) or 오 (o), add 아 보다 (a boda).
   - If the last vowel is 하 (ha), use 해 보다 (hae boda).
   - For all other vowels, add 어 보다 (eo boda).
3. The word 보다 (boda) means "to see" but in this context implies "to try".
