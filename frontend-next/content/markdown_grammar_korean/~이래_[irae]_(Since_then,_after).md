# Grammar Point: ~이래 [irae] (Since then, after)
## Introduction
The grammar point **~이래** (irae) is used in Korean to indicate a period of time that has passed since a specific point in the past. It is often translated to English as "since then" or "after." This construction is useful when discussing events or situations that have continued or changed since a particular moment.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **~이래 (irae)** indicates the duration since a certain point in the past until now. 
### Structure
- The structure typically follows a noun (usually time-related words like years, months, days, etc.) + **이래**.
- Depending on the noun's final consonant, the form changes:
  - If the noun ends with a consonant, use **-이래**.
  - If the noun ends with a vowel, use **-래**.
### Formation Diagram
| Noun Ending | Form               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Consonant   | Noun + 이래        |
| Vowel       | Noun + 래          |
### Example Structure
- **사랑하기 시작한 **이래** 두 년이 지났어요.**
  - (It's been two years **since I started to love**.)
## Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **~부터 [buteo]**: This means "from" a certain time and does not inherently indicate the passage of time like ~이래. 
  - **Example:** 주말부터 시작할 거예요. (I will start from the weekend.)
  
- **~후 (hu)**: This means "after" but is often used for more specific events in succession.
  - **Example:** 수업 후에 식사합니다. (I eat after class.)
**Differences:**
- ~이래 indicates how long it has been since something occurred, while ~부터 establishes a starting point without implying duration.

## Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
Using **이래** can reflect Korean social norms of emphasizing time, continuity, and situations over temporal measurement. In formal settings, using this grammar shows respect and acknowledgment of the past.
### Levels of Politeness and Formality
While using **이래** can be casual or formal, the politeness level will depend on the verb forms and context you pair it with:
- Informal: **너랑 만난 이래 친구가 됐어.** (Since I met you, we became friends.)
- Formal: **부장님을 뵌 이래 좋은 조언을 받았습니다.** (Since meeting the manager, I have received good advice.)
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **시간이 이래** (Since then): Often used to reflect back on a significant change or moment in life.
## Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Incorrect Noun Form:** Not conjugating correctly based on noun endings.
   - **Wrong:** 한 달 래 (Correct: 한 달 이래)
  
2. **Context Misuse:** Using this form in a context where duration isn't necessary or doesn't relate to the speaker's situation.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:** Think of **이래** as "in the duration of an **era**." Both relate to a span of time that has passed.
## Summary and Review
