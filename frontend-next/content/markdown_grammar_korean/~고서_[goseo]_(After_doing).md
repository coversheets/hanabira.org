# Grammar Point: ~고서 [goseo] (After doing)
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point ~고서 (goseo) is used to indicate that one action or event occurs after completing another action. It plays a crucial role in conveying the sequence of actions in Korean, making it essential for effective communication.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: ~고서 means "after doing" or "having done" something. It connects two verbs where the second action follows the completion of the first.
- **Structure**: 
  - The construction involves taking the verb stem and attaching -고서. 
  - Example Structure: **[Verb Stem] + -고서**
### Formation Diagram
```
[Action 1] + 고서 → [Action 2]
       |
  (Completion of Action 1)
```
### Examples of Verb Stems
- 가다 (gada - to go) → 가고서 (gagoseo - after going)
- 먹다 (meokda - to eat) → 먹고서 (meokgoseo - after eating)
## 3. Comparative Analysis
~고서 is similar to other conjunctions that express time sequences, such as:
- **-고**: Just as ~고 connects two actions but without emphasizing the completion of the first before the second.
  - Example: "간다" (I go) + "먹는다" (I eat) = "가고 먹는다" (I go and eat)
- **-은/는 후에**: This also indicates "after," but it is often more formal than ~고서.
  - Example: "먹은 후에" (after eating)
### Key Difference:
- ~고서 stresses the completion of the first action before the second begins, while the others may not imply complete execution.
