## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure ~(으)실 거예요 is formed by attaching the suffix -(으)실 to the verb stem, followed by 거예요. Here’s how it breaks down:
- **(으)실**: This ending is the future tense honorific form of a verb. It indicates a respectful intention or assumption about an action.
    - Use “-실” when the verb stem ends with a consonant.
    - Use “-으실” when the verb stem ends with a vowel.
- **거예요**: This part means "is (likely)" and adds the nuance of probability to the statement.
