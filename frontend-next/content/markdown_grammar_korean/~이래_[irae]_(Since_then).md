# Grammar Point: ~이래 (irae) - Since Then
## 1. Introduction
The Korean grammar point ~이래 (irae) is used to indicate a period of time that has passed since a certain point in the past. It emphasizes continuity from that moment until the present. This structure is commonly used in both spoken and written language.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **~이래** (irae) translates to "since then" or "since that time" in English. It conveys that a certain state or condition began at a specific point in the past and continues up to now.
### Structure
- The structure for using ~이래 (irae) is:
  **[Noun] + (이)래**
  - **Noun + 이래**: Use when the noun ends in a consonant.
  - **Noun + 래**: Use when the noun ends in a vowel.
  
### Example Formation Diagram
```
Noun + (이)래 → Indicates a period since a past point
Examples:
- 1년 (1 year) -> 1년이래 (since 1 year ago)
- 고등학교 (high school) -> 고등학교 이래 (since high school)
```
## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Similar Grammar Points**: 
  - **~부터 (buteo)**: meaning "from" or "since" with an emphasis on the starting point but does not necessarily indicate the continuity to the present.
    - Example: "학교에 가기 시작한 지 3년부터" (Since I started going to school for 3 years).
  - **~이후 (ihu)**: meaning "after" but does not emphasize the time elapsed since the starting point.
    - Example: "졸업 이후" (After graduation).
### Key Difference
While ~이래 focuses on the time elapsed since a specific point and suggests ongoing relevance, ~부터 indicates just a starting point without emphasizing ongoing action. ~이후 is more about sequential events rather than the passage of time.
