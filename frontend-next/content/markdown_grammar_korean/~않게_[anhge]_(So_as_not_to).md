# Grammar Point: ~않게 [anhge] (So as not to)
## Introduction
The grammar point ~않게 is used to express the idea of "doing something so as not to" or "in order to avoid" a certain action. This form helps convey intentions of avoidance or negation in the Korean language, enabling learners to speak more flexibly about their desires and intentions.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of ~않게 consists of the verb stem + 않다 + 게. Here’s how it breaks down:
1. **Verb Stem**: Remove 하다 (hada) or any other verb conjugation to get to the base form.
2. **않다**: This means "not" and negates the action of the verb.
3. **게**: This ending changes the negation into an adverbial phrase that indicates purpose ("so as not to").

### Examples
- For the verb 가다 (gada - to go): 
  - 가다 → 가지 않다 → 가지 않게 (so as not to go)
- For the verb 먹다 (meokda - to eat):
  - 먹다 → 먹지 않다 → 먹지 않게 (so as not to eat)
## Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **~지 않다 [ji anhta]**: Similar to ~않게, it negates an action but does not indicate purpose.
  - **Example**: 가다 → 가지 않다 (I do not go).
- **~지 않도록 [ji an torok]**: While ~않게 indicates intention, ~지 않도록 can be used to explicitly outline instructions or rules to prevent an action.
  - **Example**: 늦지 않도록 해주세요 (Please do [it] so that you do not arrive late).
### Key Differences
- **~않게** is purpose-driven (intended result).
- **~지 않다** is straightforward negation without purpose.
- **~지 않도록** focuses on preventing an action explicitly, often used in a more prescriptive manner.

## Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Confusing ~않게 with other negations**: Learners often mix up ~않게 with simple negations. It’s crucial to remember that ~않게 indicates purpose.

### Learning Strategies
