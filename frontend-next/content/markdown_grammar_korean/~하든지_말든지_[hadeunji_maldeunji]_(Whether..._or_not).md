## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of **~하든지 말든지** can be broken down as follows:

  ```
  [Action verb stem + -든지] + [negated action verb stem + -든지]
  ```

## 3. Comparative Analysis
This grammar structure is similar to the use of **~든지** or **-거나** in other contexts, however, the nuance is different:
- **~든지** indicates a choice between options without emphasizing indifference.
- **-거나** is another form that can express options but is usually used with a different structure.
**Example of Differences**:
- **하든지** (hadeunji) - “(You) do it or not.”
- **하던가** (hadeunga) - “(You) might do it.”
  
In contrast, **~하든지 말든지** emphasizes that the speaker is not particularly concerned about the action being taken.
