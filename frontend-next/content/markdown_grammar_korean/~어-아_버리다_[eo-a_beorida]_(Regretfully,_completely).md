# Grammar Point: ~어/아 버리다 [eo/a beorida]
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point ~어/아 버리다 is used in Korean to express the completion of an action, often with a nuance of regret, disappointment, or unintentional consequence. It emphasizes that something has happened completely, and often the speaker feels a sense of loss or regret about that completion.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: When you say something like "봤어 버리다" (I saw it), it implies that not only did you see it, but that the act of seeing is now complete and something may have been lost because of it.
- **Structure**: The structure combines the verb stem with either "어" or "아" based on the final vowel of the verb stem, followed by "버리다."
### Formation
1. Identify the verb stem.
2. Determine the final vowel:
   - If the last vowel is ㅏ or ㅗ, use "아" 
   - If it's anything else, use "어"
3. Add "버리다" to the conjugated form.
### Examples of Formation
- **가다 (to go)** → 가 + 아 + 버리다 → 가 버리다
- **먹다 (to eat)** → 먹 + 어 + 버리다 → 먹어 버리다
- **하다 (to do)** → 하 + 어 + 버리다 → 해 버리다
### Visual Aid
| Verb        | Verb Stem | Final Vowel | Conjugation   | Complete Form   |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 가다        | 가        | ㅏ          | 가 + 아       | 가 버리다       |
| 먹다        | 먹        | ㅓ          | 먹 + 어       | 먹어 버리다     |
| 하다        | 하        | ㅏ          | 하 + 아       | 해 버리다       |
## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Similar Points**: 
  - Verb + -어/아야 하다: This expresses necessity or obligation, which does not carry the nuance of regret or completion.
  - Verb + -는 바람에: This indicates causation from an action but lacks the emotional weight of regret found in ~어/아 버리다.
