## Comparative Analysis
- **고 vs. 와/과**: While "고" can be used with both nouns and verbs, "와" (wa) and "과" (gwa) are more strictly for nouns and are used based on the final consonant of the noun.
  - Example: 학생과 선생님 (student and teacher), but *학생고 선생님* is incorrect.
  
- **고 vs. ~(으)면서**: The structure "면서" means "while doing" or "at the same time," which implies simultaneous action, unlike "고," which indicates simple addition. 
  - Example: 공부하면서 음악을 듣다 (do studying while listening to music) vs. 공부고 음악을 듣다 (study and listen to music).
