# Korean Grammar Point: ~했기에 [haetgie] (Because)
# Detailed Grammar Explanation: ~했기에 [haetgie] (Because)
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point **~했기에** (haetgie) is used to express a causal relationship, meaning "because" or "since." It is often used to provide a reason for a particular action or statement that follows. This construct indicates that the action described happened in the past.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
**~했기에** is formed from the verb stem in the past tense followed by the suffix **-기에**. Here’s how it breaks down:
1. **Verb Stem**: The basic form of a verb, minus the 해 (to do) for verbs that conjugate in the past tense.
2. **Past Tense Suffix**: This suffix indicates completion of the action - in this case, using **했** (haet) which is the past tense of "하다" (to do).
3. **Causal Connecting Suffix**: **-기에** connects the action to the reason, emphasizing that the second clause follows logically.
### Structure
