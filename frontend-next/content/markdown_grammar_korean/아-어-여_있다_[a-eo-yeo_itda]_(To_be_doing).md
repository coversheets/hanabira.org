## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar Points
- **-고 있다 (to be doing)**: This structure is also used to describe ongoing actions, e.g., "먹고 있다" (is eating). The difference is that -고 있다 emphasizes the action in progress, while 아/어/여 있다 often describes a state resulting from an action.
- **-아/어/여 가다 (to go doing)**: This structure indicates a change of state or movement towards performing an action, e.g., "먹어 가다" (go to eat), which is different from just being in that action.

### Idiomatic Expressions
- **-어 있다 (to be in a state of):**
   - 사용 중이다 (is in use) can be a more formal way to say something is being used, i.e., a machine.
