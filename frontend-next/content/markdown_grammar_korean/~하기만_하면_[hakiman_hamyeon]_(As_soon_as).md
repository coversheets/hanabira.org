## Introduction
The expression ~하기만 하면 is used in Korean to convey the idea of something happening immediately or as soon as a certain action is completed. This structure emphasizes that only the action mentioned is needed for something else to happen.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: The structure indicates that when a specific action (하기) is completed, something else will happen. It's used for expressing conditionality, where the fulfillment of the first action leads to the second outcome. 
- **Structure**: 
  - The format is as follows: **[Verb stem + 하기] + 만 + 하면**
  - Example: 가다 (to go) → 가기 + 만 + 하면 = "As soon as [someone] goes..."

## Comparative Analysis
- Similar Expressions:
  - **~면 (myeon)**: This is another conditional structure that means "if." It is less immediate than ~하기만 하면, which stresses the urgency or immediacy of the action.
    - Example: 집에 가면 (If [someone] goes home) vs. 집에 가기만 하면 (As soon as [someone] goes home).
  
- Nuances: 
  - While both can express conditionality, ~하기만 하면 implies a more definitive correlation between the action and the outcome than simple conditional clauses.
