## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
1. **Structure**: The basic structure of this grammar point is formed by attaching **-어야 하다** or **-아야 하다** to the verb stem.
   - **Rule for vowel harmony**:
     - For verbs that end in the vowel **ㅏ or ㅗ**, use **-아야 하다**.
     - For verbs that end in vowels other than **ㅏ or ㅗ**, use **-어야 하다**.
2. **Formation Diagram**:
   ```
   Verb Stem + (아/어)야 하다
   ```
   - Example:
     - 가다 (gada; to go) + 아야 하다 → 가야 하다 (gayahada; have to go)
     - 먹다 (meokda; to eat) + 어야 하다 → 먹어야 하다 (meogeoyahada; have to eat)
### Meaning
- **Must do**: Indicates something that is necessary or required.
- **Should do**: Often conveys a recommendation.

## Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis

  - Mistake: 가야 하다 → Correct usage, but might say 걸어야 하다 (walk) incorrectly if misapplying rules.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: **A is for 아 and O is for 어**. Think "A" for "A" verbs (가다, 오다) and "E" for all others (되다, 하다).
