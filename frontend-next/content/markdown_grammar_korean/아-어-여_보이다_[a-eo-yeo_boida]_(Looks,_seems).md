## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **Similar Structures**: 
  - **처럼 (cheoreom)**: "like" or "as if." Whereas **아/어/여 보이다** expresses an opinion based on appearance, **처럼** is often used in comparisons:
    - Ex: "그는 나처럼 똑똑해 보인다." (He looks smart like me.)
  
- **다르다 (dareuda)**: "to be different." While **-아/어/여 보이다** can suggest resemblance or similarity, 다르다 does not infer appearance but difference.
