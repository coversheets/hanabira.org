## Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance

- This can highlight how emotions can be tied to specific actions or events.

- **Correction**: "내가 어제 만날 때마다 기뻤어요." (It’s better to match tenses appropriately.)
### Learning Strategies
- **Tip**: Remember that "마다" indicates repetition. You can think of it as a trigger word for actions that occur regularly.
- **Mnemonic**: "마 다" sounds like "my da,” picturing your friend "every time," encouraging consistency in experiences.
