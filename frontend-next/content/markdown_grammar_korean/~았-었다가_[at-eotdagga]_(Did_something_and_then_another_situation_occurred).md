- **~자마자 (jamaja)**: Indicates that one action happens immediately after another. E.g., "과제를 제출하자마자 쉬었어요." (As soon as I submitted my assignment, I rested.)
  
### Nuances
- **~았/었다가** typically implies a more reflective transition or a notable change, while **~고** is more straightforward listing.

## Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Korean culture, the sequence of actions is often important as it can convey respect and the order of events can reflect social hierarchy. 
### Levels of Politeness
Using this grammar point in formal settings is crucial to maintain politeness. Always pay attention to the ending form of verbs when speaking to superiors or elders.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- "갔다가 잊어버렸다" (I went and then forgot): This emphasizes the sequence and transition from one action to a forgetful state.
## Common Mistakes and Tips

   - Incorrect: "학교에 가다가 친구를 만나요."
   - Correct: "학교에 갔다가 친구를 만났어요."
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Remember that ~다가 connects two past actions - think of it as a "bridge" from one completed action to another situation.
