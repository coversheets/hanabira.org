# Grammar Point: ~서야 [seoya] (Only after)
## 1. Introduction
The Korean grammar point ~서야 is used to indicate that a particular event or action can only take place after a specified condition is met. It emphasizes a sequence of events where the second action is contingent upon the completion of the first.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: This grammar structure conveys the idea of something happening only after a certain condition is fulfilled. It often translates to “only after” or “not until” in English.
  
- **Structure**:

  - Example Verb: 가다 (to go) → 가서야
  - Overall structure: **[Action 1 (verb) + 서야 + Action 2 (verb)**

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with Similar Grammar Points
- **~고 나서 [go-naseo]**: This also indicates a sequence of events but does not carry the implication of exclusivity. For example: 
  - 밥을 먹고 나서 공부했다. (I studied after eating.)
- **~면 [myeon]**: Indicates a conditional statement rather than a sequential one.
  - 비가 오면 집에 있다. (If it rains, I stay at home.)
**Difference**: 
- ~서야 emphasizes that Action 2 occurs only after Action 1 is completed, whereas ~고 나서 simply states the order without restriction.
