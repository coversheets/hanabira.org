  - **도 (do)** vs. **도 (do) as "too"**: While both usages of 도 imply inclusion, using it to indicate "too" does not have the same emphasis on surprise as when used for "even." 
  - **밖에 (bakke)**: This indicates exclusivity, meaning "only." For example, "사과밖에 없어" (I have only an apple) contrasts with "사과도 있어" (I also have an apple), which implies more than one item/subject is included.
