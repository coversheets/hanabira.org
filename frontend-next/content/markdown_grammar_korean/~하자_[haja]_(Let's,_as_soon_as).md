## Introduction
The Korean grammar point ~하자 is used to express the suggestion or proposal of an action that should be done together or immediately. It is an informal way of inviting someone to do something, usually among friends or peers.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: The suffix ~하자 means "let's do [something]" or "as soon as we do [something]." It’s used when you want to propose an action together.
- **Structure**: 
  - The base verb can be modified by adding -자 after it. 
  - If the base verb stem ends with a vowel or consonant, it’s simply followed by 하자. 
  - For example, from the verb 배우다 (to learn), it is shortened to 배워 (learn) + 하자 = 배우자 (let's learn).
### Formation Diagram
```

- Example:
  - 가다 (to go) → 가 + 하자 = 가자 (let's go)
  - 하다 (to do) → 하 + 자 = 하자 (let's do)
### Visual Aids
| Verb Stem | + 하자 | Result          |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 가다      | + 하자 | 가자 (let's go) |
| 먹다      | + 하자 | 먹자 (let's eat) |
| 공부하다  | + 자   | 공부하자 (let's study) |
## Comparative Analysis
- This grammar point is similar to **~자 (ja)**, which is merely an ending that can also suggest an action. The difference lies in context; ~하자 suggests immediacy to the action or a common decision, while ~자 may just imply a suggestion without urgency.
- Other variants include the formal **~합시다 (hapsida)**, where a higher level of politeness is conveyed. For example:
  - **Let's eat**: 
    - ~하자: 먹자 (informal) 
    - ~합시다: 먹습니다 (formal)
