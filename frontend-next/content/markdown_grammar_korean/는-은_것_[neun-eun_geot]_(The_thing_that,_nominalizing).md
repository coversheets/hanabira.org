# Grammar Point: 는/은 것 [neun/eun geot] (The thing that, nominalizing)
## 1. Introduction
The grammar point **는/은 것** is used in Korean to nominalize verbs. This means that it turns a verb phrase into a noun phrase, allowing the speaker to refer to actions or states as "the thing that..." or simply "the act of...". It is a commonly used construction that can help create complex sentences and express thoughts in a more detailed way.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure involves attaching **는** (for verbs) or **은** (for adjectives) to verbs or adjectives, followed by **것**. This forms a noun phrase expressing the concept of an action or description.
#### Structure
- **For verbs**: Verb stem + **는 것**
- **For adjectives**: Adjective stem + **은 것**

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Difference Between **그것** and **것**
- **것** itself is a noun meaning "thing".
- Adding **는/은** transforms it into a nominal phrase, highlighting a specific action or characteristic.
### Similar Structures
- **(기가 어렵다)** - "It is hard to" vs. **(는 것 같다)** - "It seems like the (action)..."
  - Both expressions involve action reference, but **는/은 것** encapsulates the action in a noun form.

## 5. Cultural Notes

### Idiomatic Expressions

  - **Translation**: To think about the action of doing.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Using **는/은** incorrectly with adjectives**: 
   - Incorrect: "나는 예쁜 것이다." (Should use "예쁜" directly)

2. **Confusing the forms**: 
   - Remember that **는** is for present tense actions while **은** is for past actions or descriptions.
