## 1. Introduction
The grammar structure ~는지 모르다 is used to express uncertainty about a situation, implying that the speaker does not know if something is true or not. It is often used for reporting doubts or asking for information indirectly.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure consists of three main components:
1. **Verb stem**: This is the base form of the verb without any endings.
2. **는지**: This is a grammatical marker that combines the verb stem and ‘지’ to indicate that the speaker is uncertain about something.
3. **모르다**: This means "to not know."
### Structure
- For **action verbs**, the verb stem will take the form of ~는지:
  - Example: 가다 (gada - to go) → 가는지 (ganeunji)
- For **descriptive verbs (adjectives)**, the verb stem will take the form of ~은지:
  - Example: 예쁘다 (yeppeuda - to be pretty) → 예쁜지 (yeppunji)
### Formation Diagram
```
Action Verb → [Verb Stem] + 는지 + 모르다
               가다 → 가는지 + 모르다
               (to go)   → (don’t know if going)
Descriptive Verb → [Adjective Stem] + 은지 + 모르다
                     예쁘다 → 예쁜지 + 모르다
                      (to be pretty) → (don’t know if pretty)
```
