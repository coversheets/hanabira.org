## Introduction
The grammar structure ~(으)려는 참이다 is used to express that someone is in the state of wanting to do something. It conveys a sense of intention or ongoing desire to perform an action.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **~(으)려는**: This part indicates intention or plan, derived from the verb ‘-려다’ or ‘-고자 하다’ which means "to intend to" or "to want to".
- **참이다**: This means "to be right now" or "to be in the act of", emphasizing that the feeling or intention is current and genuine.
### Structure
The structure can be broken down as follows:
1. **Base Verb + (으)려**: Add -려 (for verbs ending in a vowel) or -으려 (for verbs ending in a consonant) to indicate intention.
2. **는 참이다**: This part confirms that the intention is genuine or real.
