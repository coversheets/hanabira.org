   - 예: 돈이 없어서 친구마저 못 만났다. (I couldn't even meet my friend because I have no money.)
  
- **~조차** can be more neutral or even positive, emphasizing surprise.
   - 예: 너 조차 이걸 몰라? (Even you don’t know this?)
### Nuance
- While both ~조차 and ~마저 convey the idea of “even,” ~조차 often implies an unexpected quality or extreme whereas ~마저 may carry more of an exclusionary tone.
