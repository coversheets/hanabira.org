## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **위해서 (wihaeseo)**: This means "for the sake of" and can also express purpose. However, it does not indicate intention like **~고자 하다** does. For example:
  - **밥을 먹기 위해서 가다.** (I go in order to eat rice.)
  
- **하려고 하다 (haryeogo hada)**: This literally translates to "to try to do" and denotes intention but can imply a more casual or immediate intent compared to **~고자 하다**.
### Key Differences
| Grammar Point | Meaning           | Use Case                            |

| ~위해서      | For the sake of   | General purpose-based expressions    |
