## 1. Introduction
In this lesson, we will explore the Korean grammar point ~하기는, which is used to express contrasts or concessions similar to "though" or "although" in English. This construction allows speakers to acknowledge one fact while simultaneously presenting another that may contrast with it.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of ~하기는 combines the verb or the adjective stem + 기 (gi) + 는 (neun). Here’s the breakdown:
- **Verb/Adjective Stem**: The base form of the verb or adjective without any endings.
- **기 (gi)**: This nominalizes the verb/adjective, turning it into a noun form ("doing", "being", etc.).
- **는 (neun)**: This suffix indicates that what is being said is in contrast with or provides a qualification to the main clause.
### Meaning, Structure, Formation Diagram
- **Literal Meaning**: "As for doing...".
- **Function**: To present a contrasting situation or to soften a statement, allowing the speaker to acknowledge one fact while contradicting or qualifying it with another.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
While ~하기는 emphasizes contrast, it is similar to other structures such as:
- **~지만 [jiman]**: This also indicates contrast but is more straightforward in structure. 
   - Example: "예쁘지만 비싸요." (It's pretty, but it's expensive.)
- **~ㄴ데/는데 [nde/nente]**: Used to provide background information before contrasting it.
   - Example: "예쁜데, 너무 비싸요." (It's pretty, but it's too expensive.)
The key difference is that ~하기는 often focuses more on the action or state being referenced, which can make it slightly softer and more reflective.
