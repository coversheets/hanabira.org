## Core Grammar Explanation
### Structure
The structure consists of three main components:
- A verb stem or adjective + ~지 (ji) 
- Optional negation + 않을까 (anheulkka)
- The phrase 하다 (hada) which translates to "to think" or "to do."
### Formation Diagram
```
[Verb/Adjective Stem] + 지 (ji) + 않을까 (anheulkka) + 하다 (hada)
```
### Breakdown
1. **Verb/Adjective Stem**: Identify the stem of the verb or adjective you want to use.
2. **Add ~지**: This connects the stem to the following phrase.
3. **Negation ~ 않을까**: This expresses doubt or speculation, often translated as "I wonder if not" or "might not."
4. **끝내 하다**: The word 하다 is attached to signify the act of thinking or considering the guess.
### Example Breakdown
- **가다 (gada - to go)** → 가 (ga) + 지 → 가지 않을까 하다 – "I guess [you] might not go."
- **예쁘다 (yeppeuda - to be pretty)** → 예쁠 (yeppleul) + 지 → 예쁠지 않을까 하다 – "I guess [she] might not be pretty."
