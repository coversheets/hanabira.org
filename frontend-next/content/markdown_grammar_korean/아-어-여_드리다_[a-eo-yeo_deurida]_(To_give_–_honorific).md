The grammar point **아/어/여 드리다** is used to express the act of giving something to someone in a polite or honorific manner. It conveys respect towards the recipient, making it appropriate for use in formal situations, especially when talking about services provided to elders or superiors.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation

The choice of **아, 어**, or **여** depends on the final vowel of the verb stem:
- If the stem ends in **ㅏ** or **ㅗ**, use **아**.
- If the stem ends in any other vowel, use **어**.
- If the last vowel is **하**, use **여**.
