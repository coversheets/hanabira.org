~해보다 is often compared with other expressions like:
- **~는 것** (noun form): This can also indicate an experience but is used in a more general sense.
  - Example: 하는 것 (haniun geot; the act of doing)
  
- **~아/어서** (because of doing): This indicates a reason for doing something rather than an attempt.
