## 1. Introduction
The grammar point ~(으)다가 is used to indicate a shift or transition in actions or states. It can be translated as "and then," "but," or "while" in English, depending on the context. This expression often emphasizes that the first action was interrupted or that a new action took place as a result of the first.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Structure**: The structure can be broken down as follows:
  - **Verb Stem + 다가**: When the verb stem ends with a consonant, you add "다가" directly.
  - **Verb Stem + 으다가**: When the verb stem ends with a vowel, you add "다가" following a "으", making it "으다가".
### Meaning:
- It connects two actions and indicates that the first action was ongoing when the second action occurred. It can show that the second action interrupts or follows the first.
### Formation Diagram:
```
Action 1 (ongoing)  +  "다가"  →  Action 2 (following or interrupting)
  |                      |
