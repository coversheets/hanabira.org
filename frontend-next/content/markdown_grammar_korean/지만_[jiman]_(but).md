# Grammar Point: 지만 [jiman] (but)
## 1. Introduction
The Korean conjunction "지만" is used to connect two clauses or ideas, contrasting one with the other. It is equivalent to the English word "but." This grammar point is essential for creating nuanced sentences that show contrast, which is a common feature in both spoken and written Korean.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: "지만" indicates a contrast between two statements. The first statement presents a fact, while the second one introduces a contrasting idea.
- **Structure**: 
    - The structure for using "지만" is:
      - [Clause 1] + 지만 + [Clause 2]
    - If the first clause ends with a vowel, "지만" can be directly attached to the verb or adjective. If it ends with a consonant, "지만" is still used similarly.
  
### Formation Diagram
```markdown

```
- Use "지만" after:
    - A verb, adjective, or noun + 이다/아니다.
  
### Visual Aids
| Clause Type         | Example                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Adjective Clause    | "예쁘다" (to be pretty) -> "예쁘지만" |
| Verb Clause         | "가다" (to go) -> "가지만"           |
| Noun Clause (이다)  | "학생이다" (to be a student) -> "학생이지만" |
## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points
- **"아/어도"**: Used to mean "even if" or "although," while "지만" explicitly states a contrast without implying condtion.
- **"그런데"**: Can also be used to introduce a contrasting idea but is often used in speech for transitions.
### Differences
- "지만" directly contrasts two ideas, while "아/어도" suggests a conditional or concessive meaning.
- "그런데" is more informal and typically used in conversation rather than in written forms.
## 4. Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples

   (That movie is interesting, but it is long.)

## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
Using "지만" reflects the Korean cultural norm of showing respect and consideration for differing opinions. It allows speakers to acknowledge contrasting perspectives rather than solely asserting their point.
### Levels of Politeness and Formality
- "지만" is neutral; however, make sure to use appropriate politeness levels in the rest of your sentence based on the situation.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- "친구지만 적은 아니다." (We're friends, but we're not close.)
  
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- One common mistake is omitting "지만" or using it inappropriately with non-contrasting clauses.
- Mixing it up with "아/어도" could lead to confusion regarding the intended meaning.
### Learning Strategies
- Remember that "지만" is about contrast. If you're introducing a different idea or opinion, you might need "지만."
- Mnemonic: Think of "지만" as a way to "flip" the conversation to the other side.
