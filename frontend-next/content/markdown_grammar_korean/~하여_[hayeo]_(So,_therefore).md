## 3. Comparative Analysis
~하여 can be compared to a few other similar grammar points:
- **때문에 (~ttaemune):** This is often used to express a reason rather than a consequence. For example: 
  - 비가 오기 때문에 집에 있다. (Because it is raining, I stay home.)
  
- **고 (go):** This can also be used to connect sentences but does not inherently express a causal relationship. For example: 
  - 비가 오고 나는 집에 있다. (It is raining, and I am home.)
### Key Differences:
- **~하여** emphasizes the outcome, while **때문에** emphasizes the reason.
- **고** simply connects sentences without inferring causality.
