The expression ~케 하다 in Korean is used to indicate that someone is making something happen or causing a change in state. It typically conveys the meaning of 'to make (someone do something)' or 'to cause something to become a certain way.' This grammar point is quite common in both spoken and written Korean, making it essential for learners.
