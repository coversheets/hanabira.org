## 1. Introduction
The expression ~기는 하다 is a useful grammar point in Korean that conveys that an action is indeed performed, but often with an added nuance of contrast or qualification.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation

  - **~고 있다** (to be doing): Focuses more on the ongoing action, whereas ~기는 하다 implies that the action occurs but with some degree of contrast.

### Differences:
