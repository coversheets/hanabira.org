## Introduction
The phrase **~지 않을래** is commonly used in Korean to convey a refusal or a desire not to do something. It is an informal way of expressing that one does not want to participate in an action or event.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **~지 않을래** is a combination of the negation **-지** (to not), the stem of a verb, and **않을래** (I don't want to). 
### Structure
The structure can be broken down as follows:
1. **Verb stem + 지 + 않다 (to not) + -ㄴ래 (want to)**
   - You first take the verb, drop the 다 (the dictionary form), and attach **-지**.
   - Then add **않다**, conjugated to sound casual and informal as **-을래** for intentions.
### Formation Diagram
```
(Verb stem) + 지 + 않을래 ➜ (I don't want to + [Verb])
```
### Examples
1. 가다 (gada - to go) ➜ "가지 않을래" ➜ "I don't want to go."
2. 먹다 (meokda - to eat) ➜ "먹지 않을래" ➜ "I don't want to eat."
