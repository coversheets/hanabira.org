## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Similar Grammar Points:
- **~고 [go]**: This also connects actions but doesn't imply causation as strongly as ~이어서. For example, “I eat breakfast and go to school” (아침을 먹고 학교에 간다) simply states that both actions happen.
- **~아서 / ~어서 [aseo / eoseo]**: Used to indicate reason or cause, but it is generally used for actions that follow as a result. It focuses on the cause more than the sequence.
### Example Comparison:
- **~이어서**: "He studied hard, and then he passed the exam." (그는 열심히 공부했고, 이어서 시험에 합격했다.)
- **~고**: "He studied hard and passed the exam." (그는 열심히 공부하고 시험에 합격했다.)
- **~아서**: "He passed the exam because he studied hard." (그는 열심히 공부했기 때문에 시험에 합격했다.)
