# Korean Grammar Point: ~지 않다 [ji anta] (Not)
# Introduction
The Korean grammar structure **~지 않다** (*ji anta*) is used to negate verbs and adjectives, translating to "not" in English. This is a vital grammar point for expressing negation in Korean sentences.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure **~지 않다** is formed by taking the verb stem (which is the base form of the verb without the 다 ending) and adding **지 않다**. This construction can be used to create negative sentences in both written and spoken contexts.
### Structure
1. Identify the verb stem by removing **다** from the infinitive form.
2. Attach **지 않다** to the verb stem.
3. Conjugate **안** to reflect the tense and subject as needed.
#### Example Structure
- **Verb**: 가다 (gada - to go)
  - Stem: 가 (ga)
  - Negation: 가지 않다 (gaji anta - not go)
### Formation Diagram
Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate the structure:
```
Verb (다) → Verb Stem + (지 않다)
Example: 가다 → 가 + 지 않다 → 가지 않다 (not go)
```
## Visual Aids
| Infinitive | Verb Stem | Negative Form |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 가다       | 가        | 가지 않다     |
| 먹다       | 먹        | 먹지 않다     |
| 공부하다   | 공부      | 공부하지 않다 |

### Key Differences:
