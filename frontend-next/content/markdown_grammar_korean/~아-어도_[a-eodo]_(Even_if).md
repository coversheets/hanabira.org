# Korean Grammar Point: ~아/어도 [a/eodo] (Even if)
## Introduction
In Korean, the grammar point ~아/어도 is used to express the idea of "even if" or "even though." It allows the speaker to consider a hypothetical situation while making it clear that the outcome will remain unchanged regardless of that situation.
## Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
1. **Meaning**: The structure ~아/어도 conveys that despite a certain condition or situation being true, the result or action remains unaffected.
2. **Structure**: 
   - The suffix ~아/어 is attached to the verb or adjective stem depending on the final vowel of that stem.
   - Use **아** after a verb/adjective stem that ends in the vowels ㅏ or ㅗ.
   - Use **어** after a verb/adjective stem that ends in any other vowel or a consonant.

| Verb/Adjective Stem   | Ends in        | Suffix Used | Example                 | Translation               |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 가다 (gada - to go)  | a (ㅏ)         | ~아도       | 가도 (gado)             | Even if (I/you) go       |
| 먹다 (meokda - to eat)| e (ㅓ)       | ~어도       | 먹어도 (meogeodo)       | Even if (I/you) eat      |
| 크다 (keuda - to grow)| e (ㅡ)       | ~어도       | 커도 (keodeo)           | Even if (it) grows       |
| 예쁘다 (yeppeuda - to be pretty)| e (ㅣ) | ~어도       | 예뻐도 (yeppeodo)       | Even if (it) is pretty    |
## Comparative Analysis
- **Comparative Grammar Points**:
  - **~지만 [jiman] (but)**: Unlike ~아/어도, which presents an alternative condition, ~지만 presents a contrasting statement.
    - Example: 이 책은 재미있지만 (This book is interesting, but...)
  - **~려고 하다 [ryeogo hada] (to intend to)**: This indicates intention rather than a conditional relationship.
  
### Key Difference
- While ~아/어도 sets up a condition that does not change the outcome, ~지만 introduces a contradiction or counterpoint to a previous statement.
## Examples in Context
### Sentence Examples
1. **Formal Context**:
   - 비가 와도 내일 학교에 갑니다.

## Common Mistakes and Tips
