## 3. Comparative Analysis
Compared to other conjunctions such as ~뿐만 (ppunman) or ~뿐이다 (ppunida), which indicate "only," ~뿐만 아니라 adds the idea of inclusion and expansion of meaning. 
- **~뿐만 (ppunman)**: This implies exclusivity. It means "only." 
  - Example: "사과뿐만" (only apple).
  
- **~뿐이다 (ppunida)**: Stating something as being solely one thing, often seen with nouns.
