## Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The essence of ~아/어/여도 되다 revolves around seeking or giving permission. 
### Structure
The structure consists of a verb stem combined with the suffix -아/어/여 (depending on the last vowel of the verb) followed by 되다, which means 'to be okay' or 'to be permitted'. 
### Formation

2. **Add the Correct Ending**:
   - If the last vowel of the stem is **ㅏ or ㅗ**, use **-아**.
