## 1. Introduction
The grammar structure **아/어/여 지다** is commonly used in Korean to indicate a change of state or transformation. This structure is translated as "to become" in English and is highly versatile, allowing speakers to describe both physical and emotional changes.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
This grammar point combines a verb stem with the suffix **-지다**, which signifies a change in condition or state.
### Structure
1. **Identify the verb stem**: Remove the 다 (da) from the verb's dictionary form.
2. **Add the appropriate suffix**: Based on the last vowel of the verb stem, you will add either:
   - **-아지다** after a verb stem ending inㅏ or ㅗ.
   - **-어지다** after a verb stem ending in any other vowel.
   - **-여지다** after a verb stem ending in 하 (ha).
#### Formation Diagram
| Verb Stem Ending | Suffix Used | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| ㅏ or ㅗ         | -아지다     | 크다 (to grow) → 커지다 (to become big) |
| Any other vowel  | -어지다     | 덥다 (to be hot) → 더워지다 (to become hot) |
| 하                | -여지다     | 사랑하다 (to love) → 사랑해지다 (to become love) |
