## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
- **Meaning**: This structure reveals that something happened in the past, but there is an expectation or a result that contrasts with that action.
- **Structure**: The form breaks down into three parts:
  - **Verb Stem + 했었** (indicates past action)
  - **는데** (adds contrast or background context)
### Formation Diagram
| Component        | Example            |
