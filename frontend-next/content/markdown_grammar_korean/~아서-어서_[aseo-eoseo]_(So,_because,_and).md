# Grammar Point: ~아서/어서 [aseo/eoseo]
## 1. Introduction
The suffixes ~아서 (aseo) and ~어서 (eoseo) are used in the Korean language to indicate a reason or cause, connecting two clauses in a sentence. This structure often translates to "so," "because," or "and" in English, depending on the context.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The suffixes ~아서/어서 are attached to the verb stems to indicate a causal relationship. 
1. **Usage**: Used when the first action or situation leads to the second one.
2. **Verb Stems**: If the verb stem ends in a vowel, use ~아서. If it ends with a consonant, use ~어서.
### Meaning and Structure
- The structure can be broken down as follows:
```
[Action/State 1] + ~아서/어서 + [Action/State 2]
```
- Example:
  - 공부하다 (gongbuhada - to study) → 공부해서 (gongbuhaseo)
  - 가다 (gada - to go) → 가서 (gaseo)

## 3. Comparative Analysis
- **~고**: This form is used to connect two actions or statements without implying cause. For example, "I go to school and study" (학교에 가고 공부해요 - hakgyoe gago gongbuhayo).
- **Difference**: ~아서/어서 indicates causation, while ~고 connects actions without denoting any cause.
