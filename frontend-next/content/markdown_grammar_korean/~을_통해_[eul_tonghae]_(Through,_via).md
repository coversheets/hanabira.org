## 3. Comparative Analysis
The expression **~을 통해** is similar to other expressions like **~로/으로** (meaning "by"/"with") in that they both indicate the method of an action. However, **~을 통해** specifically emphasizes the aspect of going through a channel or process, while **~로/으로** may simply indicate the means without that emphasis.
For example:
- **이메일로 연락하다** (Contact via email) 
- **이메일을 통해 연락하다** (Contact through email)
The first sentence simply states the email as a means, while the second emphasizes the process involved in contacting someone through email.
