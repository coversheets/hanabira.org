# Korean Grammar Point: ~층 [cheung] (Floor count)
# TOPIK Grammar Point: ~층 [cheung] (Floor Count)
## 1. Introduction
In Korean, the suffix ~층 (cheung) is used to indicate the floor of a building. Just like in English where we say "first floor," "second floor," etc., ~층 serves a similar purpose in Korean.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The suffix ~층 attaches to a number to specify which floor is being referenced. Here’s how it works:
- The basic structure is **[Number] + 층**  
- Numbers 1 to 10 have specific forms in Korean, but beyond that, you can create higher numbers using a combination of these forms.
### Meaning, Structure, Formation Diagram
| **Korean** | **Romanization** | **English**  |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1층        | il-cheung        | first floor  |
| 2층        | i-cheung         | second floor |
| 3층        | sam-cheung       | third floor  |
| 4층        | sa-cheung        | fourth floor |
| ...        | ...              | ...          |
| 10층       | sip-cheung       | tenth floor  |
| 11층       | sip-il-cheung    | eleventh floor |
**Example Formation**:
- 1 + 층 = 1층 (first floor)
- 5 + 층 = 5층 (fifth floor)
  
### Visual Aids
Using a simple diagram to show the floors of a building:

### Idiomatic Expressions
While there are no direct idiomatic expressions involving ~층, it is often used in phrases when giving directions or discussing locations.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Common Mistake**: Confusing the term for floor with the term for room (~호). 
  - Example Error: Saying "5호" when intending to say "5층."
### Learning Strategies
