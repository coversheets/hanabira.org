# TOPIK Grammar Point: 아/어/여 주다 [a/eo/yeo juda] (To do for someone)
## 1. Introduction
The Korean grammar point 아/어/여 주다 is used to express the action of doing something for someone else. This form highlights the speaker's intention to provide help, service, or a favor to the listener or someone else.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
The structure of this grammar point is based on the verb stem followed by the suffix 주다, which means "to give." The prefix (아/어/여) modifies the verb stem, depending on the vowel harmony:
- **아주다 (a juda)** is used if the preceding vowel is either ㅏ (a) or ㅗ (o).
- **어주다 (eo juda)** is used if the preceding vowel is one of ㅓ (eo), ㅗ (o) but it’s not followed by a vowel that requires the use of '아'.
- **여주다 (yeo juda)** is used with the verb 하다 (to do), which changes to 해 (hae) + 주다 → 해주다 (hae juda).

## 3. Comparative Analysis

- **아/어 주다 vs. 주다**: Just using 주다 alone suggests giving, without the connotation of performing an activity for someone.

### Levels of Politeness
